OL,6,FSo 1993 begins. I'm a teenager aged 13,
OL,7,Fand television heralded a new era in   
OL,8,Fcommercial broadcasting.               
OL,10, Why is this significant to me? Because 
OL,11, I didn't get out much, that's why! But 
OL,12, then again, I'm not complaining, I look
OL,13, back with great fondness of how I lived
OL,14, the lifestyle that I had in the 90s.   
OL,15, Television was a great part of it,     
OL,16, until I got a driving licence in 1997  
OL,17, and my one litre Austin Metro took me  
OL,18, to a lot of places. You try lugging    
OL,19, five mates up Muswell Hill in first    
OL,20, gear. Even horses laughed at me on my  
OL,21, struggle to the top.

OL,6,GSo Carlton rings in the new year,      
OL,7,Gtelling us that they are 'TV for       
OL,8,GLondon'. Teletext on 3 and Teletext on 
OL,9, 4 are doing their best to fill Oracle's
OL,10, shoes, which to be fair they pulled it 
OL,11, off successfully.                      
OL,13, Still with four channels and a VHS     
OL,14, recorder, a new dawn awaits.           
OL,16, Feb 93: my brother tells me he is      
OL,17, getting Cable London installed. I knew 
OL,18, of its capabilities as a multi-channel 
OL,19, supplier. Of course, I had to be there 
OL,20, to see the installation for myself.

OL,6,GFor a 13 year old, who had no

OL,8,Gwas mind-blowing. Twenty-seven         
OL,9, television channels.                   
OL,11, I did nothing but scan. Terrestrial    
OL,12, services were on 1 to 4. Further on    
OL,13, from 5 were the exotic channels. Sky   
OL,14, One, Cable London's mosaic channel (a  
OL,15, matrix of other channels), Sky Movies, 
OL,16, The Movie Channel, Bravo, euroNEWS, TLC
OL,17, The Learning Channel, Discovery, L!VE  
OL,18, TV  I know I've missed a lot!

OL,8,Gborough the organisation served under  
OL,9, the name Cable Camden until they       
OL,10, expanded to other London Boroughs.     
OL,12, So if my brother got his in Enfield in 
OL,13, 1993, living in Wood Green, my street  
OL,14, didn't get served until the latter part
OL,15, of the mid-90s.                        
OL,17, I remember coming home from school     
OL,18, sometimes and regularly telephoning    
OL,19, Cable London's customer service asking 
OL,20, when my street will get turned in. I   
OL,21, was usually always told 'next year'.

OL,7,Gview films uncut, those successfully

OL,10, BBC1 and ITV were notoriously savage at

OL,13, violence.                              
OL,15, Sky (and to be fair BBC2 and Channel 4)
OL,16, played films uncut and with no adverts.

OL,17, So in Jan 1995, I went to Tempo in Wood
OL,18, Green Shopping City, secured a Pace

OL,14, of accessing more TV content than you  
OL,15, were given from four basic terrestrial
