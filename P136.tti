OL,6, As I enter the supermarket car park, I 
OL,7, park up, slip my mask on, queue to get 
OL,8, in, great. I head to the magazine      
OL,9, shelves even though I know only too    
OL,10, well that the magazine I'm looking for 
OL,11, will eventually have its own prominent 
OL,12, display where you enter the store.     
OL,14, It's use is somewhat no longer a       
OL,15, necessity. The information is subject  
OL,16, to changes. Exactly what am I on the   
OL,17, hunt for?                              
OL,19, I then wonder if it's not here this    
OL,20, week, will it be here next week?

OL,6, I hope you've guessed what I'm looking 
OL,7, for. It's somewhat a form of excitement
OL,8, from a bygone era, when mum used to    
OL,9, reliably buy two versions of the       
OL,10, magazine at a newsagent in Wood Green. 
OL,12, Once upon a time you really needed two 
OL,13, magazines. Then in 1991 something      
OL,14, trivial happened and we only needed to 
OL,15, buy one.                               
OL,17, That made the Christmas selection      
OL,18, rather challenging: what copy do I buy?
OL,19, Which is the more informed? Which is   
OL,20, easy to read? Which one has more       
OL,21, features?

OL,6, I'm sure you sussed what I'm rambling  
OL,7, on about. Week after week, I check the 
OL,8, shelves to see if the Christmas TV     
OL,9, guide is available of course!          
OL,11, Admittedly, it still fills me with some
OL,12, of that excitement of yesteryear, that 
OL,13, Christmas copy of the Radio Times and  
OL,14, TV Times magazine.                     
OL,16, It's only challenging because every    
OL,17, year I keep having to decide which     
OL,18, deserving copy my money can buy.       
OL,20, It's not an easy choice. Therefore I   
OL,21, have to look at the features.

OL,6, Do I want the feeling of the BBC or the
OL,7, feeling of that commercial extravagance
OL,8, that used to come with a copy of the TV
OL,9, Times?                                 
OL,11, It's a silly factor to consider because
OL,12, they are entirely independent competing
OL,13, publications in their own right.       
OL,15, Personally, price is a major factor.   
OL,16, Are the programme synopsis in depth? Do
OL,17, I need to turn many pages to view my   
OL,18, favourite traditional terrestrial      
OL,19, services? What does the film section   
OL,20, look like this year?

OL,6, In all honesty, I'll skim through it at
OL,7, home and then that's it, it's dumped   
OL,8, somewhere and no longer appreciated,   
OL,9, but it's still a moment's worth of     
OL,10, pleasure to look for programmes that   
OL,11, might make my Christmas nicer.         
OL,13, I still target the films section       
OL,14, looking for those classics. Nowadays   
OL,15, those films I look for are most likely 
OL,16, to appear on itv4 (A Fistful Of Dollars
OL,17, perhaps?)                              
OL,19, Then I turn to BBC Two or BBC Four     
OL,20, after Christmas Day. Usually they do a 
OL,21, great concession about something.

OL,6, Whether it's a night dedicated to      
OL,7, Morecambe and Wise or The Two Ronnies, 
OL,8, that's the kind of programming I am    
OL,9, most likely to tune into.              
OL,11, Lately Channel 5 have been dipping     
OL,12, their hands in the archives, a         
OL,13, sanitised version of LWT's Chas &      
OL,14, Dave's Christmas Knees Up.             
OL,16, The announcer had to mention that the  
OL,17, programme was edited. Wondering why and
OL,18, what was missing, I was quick to spot  
OL,19, that the credited Jim Davidson didn't  
OL,20, appear at all in the broadcast. So I   
OL,21, turned to YouTube to see it uncut :-)

OL,6, Choosing the expensive Radio Times     
OL,7, leaves a sour taste eventually,        
OL,8, thinking why didn't I just pay less for
OL,9, another magazine.                      
OL,11, But it's a lovely Christmas habit and a
OL,12, nod to what I used to do when I was a  
OL,13, child, apart from buying loads of blank
OL,14, VHS cassettes to record those Christmas
OL,15, blockbusters like Coming to America and
OL,16, Back To The Future - in LP mode(!)     
OL,18, Nowadays we rely on the EPG and I know 
OL,19, we can time shift programmes, so now   
OL,20, hence I now just look for the special  
OL,21, strands.
