OL,7,Gknow whether to jump for joy that      
OL,8,Gschool has closed for the foreseeable  
OL,9,Gfuture, or that I have to organise work
OL,10, for students at home so that they      
OL,11, complete online through the Internet.

OL,6,GHere is some news I expected.          
OL,7,G                                       
OL,8,GIt wasn't long ago in the noughties    
OL,9, that television programmes for schools 
OL,10, started to phase out.                  
OL,12, Personally, I'm not too sure how it    
OL,13, ended. I can only conclude that online 
OL,14, video streams were more convenient than
OL,15, a cumbersome VHS tape and the glory of 
OL,16, an IT technician crashing his way into 
OL,17, a classroom with a heavy TV trolley,   
OL,18, sporting a Philips TV in a wooden box  
OL,19, and a Ferguson Videostar.

OL,8,GThe BBC's Bitesize page has announced  
OL,9, that daily lessons are coming soon.    
OL,11, It says: Beginning Monday 20 April, BBC
OL,12, Bitesize will publish daily online     
OL,13, lessons for all ages. We'll also have a
OL,14, new dedicated TV channel full of       
OL,15, learning content, podcasts on BBC      
OL,16, Sounds and loads of educational video  
OL,17, on iPlayer.                            
OL,19, I think this is good news all round. It
OL,20, should alleviate students having to    
OL,21, read and type, they need visuals too.

OL,4, RETURN OF PROGRAMMES FOR SCHOOLSD``G4/4
OL,6,GFor us aficionados, I can't expect a   
OL,7,Greturn of the long musical interludes. 
OL,8,GIt's original purpose was said to allow
OL,9, time for VT controllers to get the     
OL,10,Gtapes going and/or teachers to round up
OL,11,Gthe students onto the carpet to watch  
OL,12,GMusic Time. Not sure which is true.    
OL,14, School programming filled a            
OL,15, broadcasting gap when television       
OL,16, entertainment was something for the    
OL,17, evening. That changed in the 1980s when
OL,18, broadcasters started to increase their 
OL,19, hours into the daytimeC(that's another 
OL,20,Cstory),Gbefore going 24 hours. I'll be 
OL,21, eager to see how this goes.
