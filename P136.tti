OL,6, This article is pure speculation of    
OL,7, what may happen in this decade of      
OL,8, broadcasting - there's no insider      
OL,9, information, just an educated guess as 
OL,10, to what may come.                      
OL,12, It's all going to begin with FTTP - to 
OL,13, the layman that is an old computer     
OL,14, science term called Fibre To The       
OL,15, Premises, whom I think can be

OL,6, He jokingly mentioned about a James    
OL,7, Bond type villain buying up all the    
OL,8, telcos of the world and extracting all 
OL,9, the copper from the grounds to sell on 
OL,10, and make millions. Actually I don't

OL,17, around to install Sky+ HD when I moved 
OL,18, into my home in 2014. He was flirting

OL,7, there is some hybrid thing going on    
OL,8, with that system.                      
OL,10, Satellite TV was a massive thing in the

OL,12, accept a saucer-looking object sticking
OL,13, out of our house like an unwanted zit.

OL,6, with a strand of fibre and then all    
OL,7, your voice and data is entirely

OL,6, There's already a handful of IP based  
OL,7, services touted as part of Freeview.   
OL,9, Dial 271, wait about half a minute to  
OL,10, 'connect' to Channelbox and a wealth of
OL,11, channels to choose from will appear.   
OL,13, If it's one thing that service has got 
OL,14, right, is that it remembers your       
OL,15, previous selection, so at least if you 
OL,16, really do only digest only one TV      
OL,17, channel, you only need to wait a moment
OL,18, for it to appear. I have to admit, in  
OL,19, terms of technical accessibility and   
OL,20, ease of use, that's probably best of   
OL,21, the rest at this time in my experience.

OL,7, Hellenic TV, which was the first

OL,9, the ITC took charge in 1991.           
OL,11, HTV was initially available via Cable  
OL,12, London in the 1990s, who used to be    
OL,13, Cable Camden until they expanded their

OL,16, and parts of Haringey.

OL,6, I digress, but as a broadcaster, what  
OL,7, could go wrong with a full television  
OL,8, service guzzled into your living room  
OL,9, on tap through fibre and one-way       
OL,10, antennas are switched off? I know it's 
OL,11, a far-fetched prospect. With a private 
OL,12, service provider through the future IP 
OL,13, network you're going to be dependent on
OL,14, a 'connection' to a server, so you can 
OL,15, have this active link... but your modem
OL,16, already does this, right? At least with
OL,17, transmitter sites across the UK        
OL,18, generating a lot of carbon to keep them
OL,19, running. So maybe, it could be an      
OL,20, opportunity to scale back on that.
