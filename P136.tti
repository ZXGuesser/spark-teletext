OL,6, Actually, it was I who launched the    
OL,7, original Channel 5. I launched it in my
OL,8, kitchen during a half-term holiday in  
OL,9, 1987. It was an irregular service, as  
OL,10, head channel controller I was only aged
OL,11, seven!                                 
OL,13,BWith a reporter's pad, I started to    
OL,14,Bwrite my schedules. I selected         
OL,15,Bprogrammes from the Radio Times and TV 
OL,16,BTimes. They were carefully curated so  
OL,17,Bthat times didn't conflict. Gaps were  
OL,18,Bfiled with pages from Oracle, before I 
OL,19,Bplayed continuity announcer to my      
OL,20,Bviewers and joined either BBC, ITV or  
OL,21,BChannel 4.

OL,6, Sometimes I would opt out (the idea was
OL,7, there but the term wasn't). I would    
OL,8, provide programming via VHS, usually an
OL,9, array of films from my brother's       
OL,10, library. You'd find an 18-rated film   
OL,11, being played out at 1pm - with no      
OL,12, regard for censorship. I was aware that

OL,11, that as an infant, not only did I run a

OL,13, inadvertently invented a version of the

OL,17,Bwith this. I learned about him through 
OL,18,Bthe news in 1986. With a static image  
OL,19,Bof him on the TV, I was mesmerised that
OL,20,Bhe was the man running BBC1. Lord Grade
OL,21,Binfluenced me to run a TV channel.

OL,9, Not exactly The Sun or Daily Mirror,

OL,11, Express, with a bit of Hello! Magazine
