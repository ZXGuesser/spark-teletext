OL,6, Tong ago in the infancy of the internet
OL,7, there was a band of somewhat strange   
OL,8, characters who set themselves a task...
OL,10, They took television with them into a  
OL,11, parallel universe where ATV lived on   
OL,12, into the 90s and had a sparkling set of
OL,13, modern graphics, albeit often based on 
OL,14, the classic look of the original logos 
OL,15, and idents.                            
OL,17, These people were pleased with their   
OL,18, hobby and very little harm was done.   
OL,19, Pennines Television shared network     
OL,20, space with Rediffusion Anglia and the  
OL,21, parallel universe never encroached on  
OL,22, our reality.

OL,6, Until YouTube lumbered across the      
OL,7, horizon and with it came a presence    
OL,8, that everyone even vaguely interested  
OL,9, in Television history became aware of. 
OL,10, I speak of Cwiliams1976.               
OL,12, A man who is clearly interested in all 
OL,13, things to do with ITV from the past    
OL,14, until the present day but possessing no
OL,15, discernable talent in making or        
OL,16, labelling his mock videos. By 2013, he 
OL,17, had a channel online consisting of 1800
OL,18, poorly made and utterly bewildering    
OL,19, videos which made ITV look like an     
OL,20, incessant parade of temporary faults,  
OL,21, strikes and censorship.

OL,6, Nearly all of these videos were voiced 
OL,7, by himself and featured static, fuzzy  
OL,8, captions dubbed with some of the most  
OL,9, dreary music that was ever trawled from
OL,10, library collections. Never less than 15
OL,11, minutes of this music was played and   
OL,12, the surreal painfulness of his complete
OL,13, lack of accuracy was hypnotic.         
OL,15, I noticed that comments were being left
OL,16, on his videos asking about whether the 
OL,17, footage was genuine and he always said 
OL,18, that it was. The fact that a child     
OL,19, could have made the videos with a      
OL,20, couple of potatoes and some blue paint 
OL,21, seemed irrelevant in his strange       
OL,22, corner of the internet.

OL,6, Further to this, I saw that his stuff  
OL,7, was popping up on other pages as       
OL,8, genuine examples of TV history! No     
OL,9, research, no background checks, his odd
OL,10, revisionism was becoming a reality.    
OL,12, None of this escaped the attention of  
OL,13, genuine enthusiasts and the campaign   
OL,14, began to encourage him to mark the     
OL,15, videos as 'mocks'. He refused because, 
OL,16, as he said, "I don't have to and it    
OL,17, makes me uncomfortable."               
OL,19, Oh well, that's alright then, is it? A 
OL,20, deeply bizarre string of comments,     
OL,21, threats and requests for saucy pictures
OL,22, on the Transdiffusion website ensued.

OL,6, It is still there if you want to take a
OL,7, look at how utterly ridiculous things  
OL,8, became. I can scarcely believe that it 
OL,9, ever occurred...                       
OL,11, Things came to a head after much hassle
OL,12, and threats of "calling the Police" on 
OL,13, us, his channel was taken away..       
OL,14, reinstated and taken away again. Peace 
OL,15, reigned and the awful videos           
OL,16, disappeared. Or at least, we thought   
OL,17, they had.                              
OL,19, A short while after the online meltdown
OL,20, of Britain's most stretched and lousy  
OL,21, continuity announcer, a new channel    
OL,22, popped into existence.

OL,6, Just a couple of familiar looking      
OL,7, videos at first but as ever, the       
OL,8, torrent started up and he's back in the
OL,9, game.                                  
OL,11, Cwilliams76 is still out there and     
OL,12, churning out his odd and frankly,      
OL,13, terrible videos. He still won't mark   
OL,14, them as mocks but the heat seems to    
OL,15, have died down. Nobody really notices  
OL,16, him any more and with modern eyes, his 
OL,17, mocks are obviously not the real deal. 
OL,18, He chunters away at the mike and in his
OL,19, world of strikes, captions and faults, 
OL,20, he's most likely fairly content. That's
OL,21, the end of this article, I will leave  
OL,22, you with some music.
