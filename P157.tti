OL,4, CThe DoctorGleft Time Lord society to  
OL,5,  experience The Universe, instead of   
OL,6,  simply observing it. She's brave,     
OL,7,  clever, silly and sometimes fallible, 
OL,8,  even when she was male. When in a     
OL,9,  tight spot, rarely will she bring     
OL,10,  superior force to bear; her solutions 
OL,11,  are instead rather ingenious.         
OL,13,  After about 30 years on TV, the show  
OL,14,  was 'rested' in the 1990s. It became  
OL,15,  an even greater success on its return 
OL,16,  in 2005. Entire families often gather 
OL,17,  to immerse themselves in the universe 
OL,18,  of the series. In the 21st century,   
OL,19,  The Doctor's love of diverse cultures 
OL,20,  is satisfied spectacularly - and she  
OL,21,  invites us along on that adventure.

OL,4,  The Doctor has shared her ship  VH0   
OL,5,  with many friendly Earthlings  Tj/?o  
OL,6,  and the occasional off-worlder.Tjpuz  
OL,7,  These include a journalist fromTj   
OL,8,  Croydon, a Scots lad from 1746,Tj  
OL,9,  a pair of school teachers and  Tj  
OL,10,  even a fellow Gallifreyan.     T*///  
OL,12,  On a seven-country tour in 2014, the  
OL,13,  programme's stars invited the world   
OL,14,  aboard the TARDIS and were met with   
OL,15,  huge enthusiasm. For a tale so very   
OL,16,  cosmic, Doctor Who really connects    
OL,17,  with audiences on a personal level.   
OL,19,  It's been a pure delight how Doctor   
OL,20,  Who has changed so much - but still   
OL,21,  retains its appeal.   F- Pete Fagan
