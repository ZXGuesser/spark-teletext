OL,6, Last time on Rex Road: Richard enjoyed 
OL,7, his new job and was getting on better  
OL,8, with Rach; Sam was released without    
OL,9, charge and still turned to Ros; Lisa   
OL,10, was annoyed by Kris's cold welcome.    
OL,12, EPISODE SEVENTY THREE                  
OL,13, Jo wanted to be more welcoming to Lisa.
OL,15, "So anyway, shall we go out in town    
OL,16, tonight?"                              
OL,18, "Yeah, sure, shall we try out your     
OL,19, local, don't think I've been to that   
OL,20, one before, what was it called?" Lisa  
OL,21, asked.

OL,6, "The Rose & Crown, we know the landlord
OL,7, Jack Redfern quite well, he's a great  
OL,8, bloke, you'll like it there I'm sure!" 
OL,10, Laura left college after a lecture and 
OL,11, saw Nathan hanging around the gates.   
OL,13, "You here again?" She snarled at him.  
OL,15, "Well, I have a pretty good idea when  
OL,16, your lectures happen now," he grinned  
OL,17, cheesily.                              
OL,19, "You stalking me?" She replied, finding
OL,20, the idea quite thrilling too.

OL,13, Nathan actually managed to look sincere

OL,6, Laura walked away from him, in an act  
OL,7, of defiance...but the truth was, she   
OL,8, felt ecstatic at what he'd said.       
OL,10, "Laura?" Her brother ran across the    
OL,11, road, having just finished work. He'd  
OL,12, got a job at the leisure centre,       
OL,13, working in the office.                 
OL,15, "What were you doing talking to that   
OL,16, loser?"                                
OL,18, "He's not that bad, anyway it's none of

OL,21, "OK! Don't blow a gasket!"

OL,6, Back at Number Six, Lisa and Kris were 
OL,7, the only ones in the house.            
OL,9, "Fancy anything to eat, Kris, I can    
OL,10, make us something?" Lisa asked.        
OL,12, Kris looked her up and down, but said  
OL,13, nothing. No doubt about it, Kris felt  
OL,14, totally threatened by Lisa. She was    
OL,15, beautiful, intelligent...so was Kris,  
OL,16, but didn't feel it.                    
OL,18, "Have I done something wrong, Kris? I'm
OL,19, trying to get on with everyone," Lisa  
OL,20, didn't get upset, she wasn't one to    
OL,21, turn on the tears easily.

OL,6, "I don't know you, and I'm not sure    
OL,7, that I want to get to know you, so just
OL,8, leave me alone!" Kris shocked Lisa into
OL,9, silence, the new housemate just leaving
OL,10, the room.                              
OL,12, Kris went to a drawer and started      
OL,13, flicking through solicitor's paperwork 
OL,14, about Gary's will.                     
OL,16, "They're too quick to welcome her into 
OL,17, this house, I'll teach everyone a damn 
OL,18, good lesson!"

OL,6, Laura and Rhys arrived home together,  
OL,7, as Paul was reading something in the   
OL,8, kitchen.                               
OL,10, "Hi Dad, what's that?" Laura asked,    
OL,11, kissing him on the cheek.              
OL,13, "Oh, nothing love," he looked          
OL,14, flustered, "just boring work stuff."   
OL,16, The truth was, Paul had discovered a   
OL,17, letter from the clinic about Ali's     
OL,18, abortion!

OL,9, Meanwhile - "Morning!" Lisa yawned as  
OL,10, she walked into the kitchen, where Kris
OL,11, was making breakfast.                  
OL,13, "Shut up," Kris said casually,         
OL,14, buttering toast.                       
OL,16, "Look, Kris," Lisa was interrupted when

OL,9, "Yeah, too many drinks last night, eh?"
OL,10, He laughed, as Kris took her toast into
