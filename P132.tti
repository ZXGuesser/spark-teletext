OL,6, It had been a couple of weeks since    
OL,7, Rachel had left Richard, and he still  
OL,8, refused to go to work and rarely left  
OL,9, Number Four. People like Max and Jack  
OL,10, were trying to keep an eye on him,     
OL,11, calling round in an attempt to make him
OL,12, snap out of this trance... but nothing 
OL,13, was working. Richard needed help. Or   
OL,14, Rachel back again.                     
OL,16, The phone had already rung about ten

OL,10, On an equally depressive note, over at

OL,6, Laura had arranged to meet Nathan in   
OL,7, Alborford Park one afternoon. It was   
OL,8, sunny and hot, as they lay on the grass
OL,9, kissing.                               
OL,11, What if someone sees us here? We're not
OL,12, exactly far from home?' Laura was      
OL,13, starting to panic about their fling.   
OL,14, After all, Kris was not someone to mess
