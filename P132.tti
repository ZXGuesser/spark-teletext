OL,6, Jack and Max had taken a trip to       
OL,7, Hamborough, a town about five miles    
OL,8, away. It was under the pretence of     
OL,9, professional investigation: a very     
OL,10, successful pub had opened that Jack    
OL,11, wanted to check out.                   
OL,13, However, it worked just as well as an  
OL,14, excuse to have a lad's day out and get 
OL,15, away from everything in Alborford.     
OL,17, "Things going well with Fiona then?"   
OL,18, Jack asked, parking on the roadside.   
OL,20, "Yeah, very well mate," Max grinned.

OL,7, tell they were becoming besotted with  
OL,8, each other.                            
OL,10, "Maybe it's time that you got your own

OL,12, to your parents' all the time?"        
OL,14, "Been thinking the same thing myself.  
OL,15, Yeah, it's time to move on, not as if I
OL,16, can't afford it. Places around here    
OL,17, cost a bomb, but then I've got a       
OL,18, massive salary!" Max laughed, Jack     
OL,19, found his showing off endearing,       
OL,20, because it was meant with good humour.
