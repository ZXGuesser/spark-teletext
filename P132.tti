OL,6, Last time on Rex Road: Laura and       
OL,7, Nathan's paths crossed again and he    
OL,8, told her he missed her; new student    
OL,9, Lisa was not made welcome by Kris, who 
OL,10, was furious with everyone; Paul had    
OL,11, discovered Ali's abortion.             
OL,13, EPISODE SEVENTY FOUR                   
OL,15, Ali and Paul had breakfast together    
OL,16, before heading off for work. Rhys and  
OL,17, Laura had already left the house.      
OL,19, "You OK, love, bit quiet this morning,"
OL,20, Ali smiled.

OL,6, "Fine," he snapped.                    
OL,8, "Look, we should talk about it if      
OL,9, there's something wrong...that's been  
OL,10, our problem before."                   
OL,12, "Right! Let's talk about why you killed
OL,13, our child shall we?! And didn't think  
OL,14, it was worth mentioning to me!" Paul   
OL,15, slammed his fist on the table with     
OL,16, rage.                                  
OL,18, "Er..look," Ali's lip trembled straight
OL,19, away as the horror of the situation    
OL,20, dawned on her.

OL,15, Paul stormed out, as Ali sat alone with
OL,16, her head in her hands. He turned out of
OL,17, Rex Road...but he wasn't going to work.
OL,19, Sam was trying to work, but felt in a  
OL,20, daze. Ros had been a supportive friend 
OL,21, during his recent troubles.

OL,6, The problem was, now he couldn't stop  
OL,7, thinking about her, realising he still 
OL,8, loved her. What could he possibly do   
OL,9, about it?                              
OL,11, "Sam! Over here, snap out of it!"      
OL,13, Kris was going through more of the     
OL,14, papers about Gary's estate, when she   
OL,15, was alone in the house. Going through  
OL,16, everything, she produced two cheques   
OL,17, belonging to Phil and Jo, together with
OL,18, copies of their signatures, and began  
OL,19, attempting to copy them.               
OL,21, "Hmmm, not bad!" She smiled.

OL,6, Laura had been getting texts from      
OL,7, Nathan all morning at college, and her 
OL,8, resolve was starting to weaken. She    
OL,9, arranged to meet him at lunchtime in   
OL,10, the Union Cafe.                        
OL,12, "What's all this about, Nathan?" She   
OL,13, asked angrily, trying to pretend that  
OL,14, she didn't really want this.           
OL,16, "I want you back. All that mess with   
OL,17, Kris made me realise how much I care   
OL,18, about you."                            
OL,20, She paused for a while, trying to think
OL,21, of a way not to leap in.

OL,6, "You really hurt me.I lost our baby for

OL,8, still hurting over that one.           
OL,10, "I know, I'm so sorry," Laura looked   
OL,11, away, just as Nathan spotted Lisa      
OL,12, Hudson walking by. The pair smiled at  
OL,13, each other and he was distracted for a 
OL,14, moment.                                
OL,16, "OK, let's go out for a drink tonight,

OL,6, Sam arrived at Number Ten after work.  
OL,8, Inside, Ros was sitting down to dinner 
OL,9, with James.                            
OL,11, "You alright, babe?" James asked,      
OL,12, winking at her.                        
OL,14, "Sure, just a bit tired!" She too was  
OL,15, wondering about Sam, and how he was.   
OL,17, "I'm in line for a bonus at work again,
OL,18, so I think we both deserve a little    
OL,19, break, fancy checking out deals later  
OL,20, and booking something?" He'd been      
OL,21, making an effort these days.

OL,6, James realised Ros deserved more, as   
OL,7, the love of his life. Yet now, was she 
OL,8, thinking the same thing about him?     
OL,10, Outside, Sam went to knock, but changed
OL,11, his mind and left again...             
OL,13, Paul arrived home, and Rhys opened the 
OL,14, front door when he heard his key       
OL,15, faltering in the lock.                 
OL,17, "Dad! What the hell's wrong?" But he   
OL,18, knew straight away that his father was
