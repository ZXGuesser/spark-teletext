OL,6, Nathan couldn't stop thinking about the
OL,7, night he'd spent at the hotel with     
OL,8, Laura, and wondered right now what he  
OL,9, was doing with Kris. He certainly      
OL,10, didn't feel any guilt about what he was
OL,11, doing.

OL,11, "Well, that'll teach him to stray from 
OL,12, the open road."
