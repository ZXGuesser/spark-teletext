OL,18, Lucas spotted them from the other side

OL,6, "We can't stop long, Ros..." Rachel    
OL,7, began. Ali noticed the women squealing 
OL,8, with delight and hugging each other.   
OL,10, "Hmmm, wonder what that's all about?"  
OL,12, Nathan was getting ready to go back to 
OL,13, the club for another day's work. If he 
OL,14, played his cards right, they may keep  
OL,15, him on permanently. He got out of bed  
OL,16, and Kris rolled over.                  
OL,18, "I s'pose I'd better get up too," she  
OL,19, sighed, "got a lecture this morning."  
OL,21, He didn't answer. All he could think   
OL,22, about was Laura and his unborn child.

OL,6, "What's wrong?" Kris asked. "Nothing,  
OL,7, just tired... I'll have a shower."     
OL,9, Kris already knew him better than that,
OL,10, and besides, she seemed to have a sixth
OL,11, sense when someone was troubled and    
OL,12, they were keeping it to themselves.    
OL,14, Something was wrong, and she was going 
OL,15, to find out what it was!               
OL,17, Max was scouring the paper for flats to
OL,18, rent, walking along the High Street,   
OL,19, when he spotted Richard and Rachel (who
OL,20, was carrying baby Harry) coming out of 
OL,21, the Magnolia Beauty Salon.

OL,6, Laura was studying in her room.        
OL,7, Luckily, she only had one exam left,   
OL,8, because she couldn't concentrate on

OL,16, "OK, I suppose," she sighed. "Don't

OL,6, Her mother probably wouldn't even      
OL,7, notice if anything was wrong, she was  
OL,8, too busy keeping her Dad on the wagon  
OL,9, and they were keeping a close eye on   
OL,10, Rhys since the bullying   and he had   
OL,11, GCSEs to go through. They weren't      
OL,12, worried about her problems surely?!    
OL,14, Ali was cleaning the windows by the    
OL,15, front door later, when Ros rushed past 
OL,16, her, all dressed up.

OL,6, It was obvious, from the look on her   
OL,7, face, that Ros wasn't going to give    
OL,8, anything away to Ali of all people.    
OL,10, Phil had met Nathan in The Rose & Crown
OL,11, during his lunch hour.
