OL,6, During the time she'd spent away from  
OL,7, Rex Road, she'd hardened up about the  
OL,8, whole situation. He could tell that she
OL,9, wasn't the emotional wreck that had    
OL,10, left... not by a long way.             
OL,12, "I know that... and I still love you,  
OL,13, but it's going to take a lot for us to 
OL,14, get over this, y'know," he noticed that
OL,15, her bump was really starting to show   
OL,16, now and the thought of his unborn child
OL,17, made him feel even more emotional.     
OL,19, "Do you mean you're willing to give    
OL,20, things another go?" Richard asked,
