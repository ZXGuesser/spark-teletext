OL,6, Last time on Rex Road: Gary's funeral  
OL,7, was an emotional and painful day,      
OL,8, causing confrontation throughout the   
OL,9, road...as Ali struggled with her secret
OL,10, and Josie struggled to get along with  
OL,11, Fiona.                                 
OL,13, EPISODE SIXTY NINE                     
OL,15, At Number Six, nobody was in the mood  
OL,16, for much.                              
OL,18, "Does anyone fancy going anywhere      
OL,19, today?" Phil asked smiling, trying to  
OL,20, lighten the mood.

OL,6, Truth was, they just couldn't move on  
OL,7, yet after Gary's death. It wasn't going
OL,8, to happen this quickly.                
OL,10, "I don't really fancy doing anything,  
OL,11, Phil," Jo sighed, flicking through a   
OL,12, magazine.                              
OL,14, "I think we need to see Gary's         
OL,15, solicitor soon don't we?" Kris asked.  
OL,16, Phil's heart sank, he didn't want them 
OL,17, to forget Gary, but at the same time   
OL,18, didn't want him to be the only thing   
OL,19, that they ever talked about!           
OL,21, "Yeah, one day next week, I'll check."

OL,6, After part of the will being revealed, 
OL,7, treating them as chief mourners at his 
OL,8, funeral, Gary had a few more surprises 
OL,9, left in him yet.                       
OL,11, Nathan was out in Norwich with a group 
OL,12, of lads he'd met through work, and they
OL,13, were pretty drunk by now, going from   
OL,14, pub to pub.                            
OL,16, "What happened to that sexy little bird
OL,17, that came to see you at work?" One of  
OL,18, them asked.                            
OL,20, "Kris? We're finished," Nathan swigged 
OL,21, from his pint glass.

OL,6, "Dump her?" He only thought for a split

OL,9, "Yeah, well I was seeing this other    
OL,10, girl at the same time, and juggling two
OL,11, ain't easy!" Nathan's laddish bragging 
OL,12, was kicking in now.                    
OL,14, "You sly old dog! So what about the    
OL,15, other girl?"                           
OL,17, "Got her pregnant, so couldn't be doing
OL,18, with any of that mess obviously! Bailed
OL,19, out of that, so now I'm on the hunt!"  
OL,20, Nathan looked over at a group of       
OL,21, giggling girls as he said this.

OL,13, bravado all he wanted, but the mess    
OL,14, with Kris and Laura had really got to  
OL,15, him, deep down. Now, as they roared    
OL,16, with laughter, he actually felt like   
OL,17, crying.

OL,6, It was Wednesday, and Jo's birthday.   
OL,7, The recent heatwave seemed to be over, 
OL,8, and she walked with Kris through       
OL,9, Alborford's High Street, the wind      
OL,10, pushing them along.
