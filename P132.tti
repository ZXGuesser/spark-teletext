OL,11,FKris lashed out at Nathan and threw him

OL,7, Gary Jacobs boy. Which I am. But it    
OL,8, means we're talking about the loss of  
OL,9, young life and all that, so it keeps

OL,7, right off the wagon... and there's no

OL,10, Back at Number Six, Phil had made Kris 
OL,11, and Jo some lunch.                     
OL,13, "I'm not very hungry, Phil, but thanks 
OL,14, anyway," said Jo.                      
OL,16, "Me neither, but thanks," added Kris.  
OL,18, Another knock at the door. This time it
OL,19, was Gary's parents. His mother appeared
OL,20, in the lounge first, in tears, and both
OL,21, Jo and Kris looked up at her.

OL,7, going, and gathered outside to wait    
OL,8, until they were on their way.          
OL,10, Kris climbed into the car first,
