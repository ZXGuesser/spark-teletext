OL,6, Last time on Rex Road: Rachel had      
OL,7, become sick of the sight of Richard and
OL,8, asked him to leave, as he had concerns 
OL,9, she was suffering with post-natal      
OL,10, depression; Jo let off steam on her    
OL,11, birthday - and Rhys decided that       
OL,12, college wasn't for him and wanted to   
OL,13, get a job.                             
OL,15, EPISODE SEVENTY                        
OL,17, "What?! I thought it was all planned?  
OL,18, You've got your place and you're due to
OL,19, start soon!" Ali tried to stop herself 
OL,20, looking furious, but she felt it.
