OL,6, Later the same week, it was a Bank     
OL,7, Holiday, and the Reynolds had decided  
OL,8, to have a family barbecue, and that    
OL,9, included inviting Fiona.               
OL,11, "Fancy a burger next?" Don asked.      
OL,13, "How many times, Dad?! She's a         
OL,14, vegetarian!" Max protested.            
OL,16, "Oh yeah, sorry love," Don looked      
OL,17, embarrassed, because he'd genuinely    
OL,18, forgot.

OL,6, "That's OK," Fiona didn't care, she was
OL,7, just enjoying the fact that she was    
OL,8, being accepted in their own way.       
OL,10, "So, how's life in Holland Road,       
OL,11, Fiona?" Josie asked, handing her a     
OL,12, glass of wine.                         
OL,14, "Absolutely fantastic, darlin'!" Josie  
OL,15, flinched when Fiona called her that,   
OL,16, but that was just her way with         
OL,17, everyone!                              
OL,19, "Done any decorating since we visited?"
OL,20, Josie asked.

OL,6, "Nah, doesn't really need it!" Fiona   
OL,7, swigged most of the wine down quickly. 
OL,8, Josie looked her up and down.          
OL,10, "Mum! Shall I put more of this chicken 
OL,11, on?" Max shouted across the garden.    
OL,13, "Shhh! Yes!" Josie replied.            
OL,15, "He's a one! Always asking me questions
OL,16, whenever he tries to cook anything at  
OL,17, home!"                                 
OL,19, Josie sighed heavily and she pretended 
OL,20, to laugh. This was going to be a long  
OL,21, afternoon.
