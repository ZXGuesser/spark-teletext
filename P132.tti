OL,6, Why was Josie so laid back? Maybe she'd
OL,7, wail and cry when he actually left,    
OL,8, thought Max. Or wasn't she that        
OL,9, bothered about him leaving?            
OL,11, Was Sam the only one who could have    
OL,12, that effect on her?                    
OL,14, Laura opened a letter from Alborford   
OL,15, College of Higher Education. She'd     
OL,16, already been rejected by the University
OL,17, of East Anglia in Norwich (well, more  
OL,18, or less, her predicted grades weren't  
OL,19, high enough) and was expecting the same
OL,20, again.

OL,6, Not so. She'd been accepted, dependent 
OL,7, on her predictions.                    
OL,9, Alone, she started to cry... how would 
OL,10, she go to college and cope with a baby 
OL,11, at the same time?                      
OL,13, She had to find Nathan and talk to him,
OL,14, she needed his support now... after    
OL,15, all, he'd promised her that she was his
OL,16, girl, that Kris was just a convenience 
OL,17, for living arrangements, and that he   
OL,18, wouldn't be with her for much longer...

OL,6, Richard and Rachel were on the lounge

OL,8, baby Harry had finally dropped off a   
OL,9, few minutes before.                    
OL,11, "I'm so knackered," sighed Rachel. She 
OL,12, couldn't believe that things had       
OL,13, changed so much. Not so long ago, the  
OL,14, only thing that would have mattered to 
OL,15, her was getting the next modelling job,
OL,16, or working the next shift at the       
OL,17, Magnolia Beauty Salon.                 
OL,19, Now, it was all baby, nappies, sleep if
OL,20, they were lucky... but she was much    
OL,21, happier than ever before. All of their 
OL,22, problems just faded away now.

OL,13, Laura got on the next bus to Norwich,  
OL,14, she had a pretty good idea which club  
OL,15, Nathan was at, he'd mentioned it once
