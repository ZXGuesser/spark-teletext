OL,6, It was clear that James knew something,
OL,7, thought Sam, his whole demeanour was a 
OL,8, giveaway and there seemed to be a mix  
OL,9, of both anger and amusement.           
OL,11, "Pleased to hear that you've been      
OL,12, friendly with my wife in my absence,   
OL,13, Sam. Am sure she appreciated your

OL,17, "Yeah, I am sure. You can take a step  
OL,18, back now though - I'm back and going

OL,20, which made Sam feel even more nervous.
