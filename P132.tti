OL,12, Ali and Laura had left for lunch in    
OL,13, town together, while Rhys was at a     
OL,14, friend's house, leaving Paul alone with
OL,15, his thoughts. He sat for a while and   
OL,16, felt sympathy for Ros Porter, and then 
OL,17, began to go over his last AA meeting.  
OL,18, "Hmmm," getting up from the sofa, he   
OL,19, went to search for something. Pretty   
OL,20, soon he found it, a whisky bottle in   
OL,21, the airing cupboard, under some towels.

OL,6, Paul took a long swig from it and sat  
OL,7, on the stairs.                         
OL,9, Jack Redfern closed the pub and made   
OL,10, his way to the outskirts of town, deep 
OL,11, in thought. He wondered if he may lose

OL,13, widowed him in the past, he felt beside

OL,16, Later, Ros and Cathy drove through the

OL,6, Cathy looked over at Ros and wondered  
OL,7, if she would keep needing her for

OL,11, "Look, there she is, the poor thing,

OL,13, Johnson and a couple of her cronies    
OL,14, were gathered outside the church, as   
OL,15, she spotted Ros. Ros noticed her,      
OL,16, familiar with her love of others'
