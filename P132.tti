OL,6, Laura walked up Rex Road towards her   
OL,7, home, when she noticed a bedroom light 
OL,8, on at Number Ten. She walked further   
OL,9, along the path, looking up at the

OL,11, dressing gown and was about to carry on
OL,12, walking when James's car pulled up.    
OL,14, "Hi Laura, Just back from town?" asked
