OL,6, I've pondered the utility of childhood 
OL,7, trinkets before in this aimlessly      
OL,8, retrospective column of mine, what with
OL,9, the likes of POGs and football stickers
OL,10, and such. But I'm going to do so again.
OL,12, Just what was, or is, the point of the 
OL,13, humble action figure, eh? I mean, they 
OL,14, happen to be representations of your   
OL,15, favourite TV shows and comic strips,   
OL,16, fine, but where's the action? I never  
OL,17, really understood it, evidently I still
OL,18, don't.

OL,6, I've owned a few myself, being the fan 
OL,7, I was of the original Mighty Morphin'  
OL,8, Power Rangers I still own a Red Dragon 
OL,9, Thunderzord. But I never really... used
OL,10, it? Is that a thing that people do?    
OL,12, It's still in its box, complete as far 
OL,13, as I know, but I assume there are and  
OL,14, were children out there who actively   
OL,15, play with these things, that's how bits
OL,16, get broken and lost.                   
OL,18, Do you just sort of smack them together
OL,19, with the action figures of the baddies?
OL,20, Who wants to buy baddies? They're bad!

OL,6, I knew a guy who liked wrestling ones. 
OL,7, You know, your diminutive plastic WWF  
OL,8, figures and such. He found a use for   
OL,9, them in recreating hardcore wrestling  
OL,10, matches, grating them against sharp    
OL,11, things and dropping or throwing them   
OL,12, from great heights.                    
OL,14, A slightly more enthusiastic version of
OL,15, chucking your parachuting (if only in  
OL,16, theory) Action Man out the upstairs    
OL,17, window, I suppose.                     
OL,19, Albeit with slightly higher chances of 
OL,20, psychological evaluation.

OL,6, I can sort of understand "dolls" to a  
OL,7, slightly greater extent. They're all   
OL,8, dolls, really, but I'll humour the     
OL,9, contingent adamant that there's a real 
OL,10, difference.                            
OL,12, Take Barbie and Ken. Not ideal role    
OL,13, models, perhaps, in their obviously    
OL,14, unattainable status as long-time       
OL,15, beauty icons and inexplicably          
OL,16, successful serial career-hopping.      
OL,18, But they could plausibly be claimed to 
OL,19, be role models in the sense that they  
OL,20, seem successful and home-building.

OL,6, But what of the likes of Hardcore Holly
OL,7, and the flippy-head Red Ranger? What of
OL,8, Lion-O and Donatello?                  
OL,10, What is their purpose? I've still no   
OL,11, idea. You could look at them, but then 
OL,12, you could just watch the TV shows or   
OL,13, read the comics. Kids aren't much for  
OL,14, ornaments anyway, they prefer toys that
OL,15, do stuff. Perhaps I'll never get it.   
OL,17, I must leave you, these Matchbox cars  
OL,18, won't drive around this mat themselves,
OL,19, Mrs Sanderson needs to go shopping and 
OL,20, this Cavalier's blocking her drive.
