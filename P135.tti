OL,5, Did you watch the wrestling last night?
OL,6, No? What about the new episode of The  
OL,7, Simpsons? The Smells Like Teen Spirit  
OL,8, video? Oh yeah, 'sorry', of course you 
OL,9, didn't, I 'forgot', you don't have Sky!
OL,11, So-called 'water cooler discussions' as
OL,12, I'm told they're called are quite hard 
OL,13, to participate in when that irritating 
OL,14, oik in your class with the social clout
OL,15, to steer them keeps using them as an   
OL,16, opportunity to brag about his family   
OL,17, being fancy enough to have Sky.        
OL,19, Pity the kid who had BSB, the poor git.

OL,5, On the upside, now he's trundling quite
OL,6, rapidly towards 40 and gets to fork out
OL,7, a cool 50 quid a month for the dubious 
OL,8, privilege of watching half a billion TV
OL,9, channels worth of complete and utter   
OL,10, tripe and it's no longer special enough
OL,11, to enable braggadocious peacocking.    
OL,13, How's that 31st series of The Simpsons 
OL,14, working out for you, Ben? I thought so.
OL,16, Contrary though it is to the respect of
OL,17, the authority of TV that held much sway
OL,18, in the past, YouTube carries a wealth  
OL,19, of content. No, not PewDiePie. Get out.

OL,5, But there was something uniquely other-
OL,6, worldly about being so used to having  
OL,7, a mere four channels of TV and finding 
OL,8, out that it was possible to buy your   
OL,9, way into an alternative universe where 
OL,10, the channel count could number in the  
OL,11, dozens.                                
OL,13, Most of it was probably as unwatchable 
OL,14, as the majority of it is now but there 
OL,15, was something magical about an unseen  
OL,16, secret portal into 'something else',   
OL,17, like being allowed to go behind a door 
OL,18, labelled 'Staff Only'. But when you're 
OL,19, old it turns out staff rooms are lame.
