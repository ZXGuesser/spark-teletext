OL,6, Retro games are hot these days. All the
OL,7, blinky bleepy nostalgia of 30 year old 
OL,8, video games starring all your favourite
OL,9, characters of yesteryear. Mario, Sonic,
OL,10, Crash Bandicoot, that dog in Ski Free  
OL,11, that's evidently not chalet-trained.   
OL,13, All very well, of course, modern or not
OL,14, it's important to preserve culture. So 
OL,15, where's all the love for the other kind
OL,16, of money-sucking bleepy-bloopy gizmos? 
OL,18, When you go out of an evening, consume 
OL,19, several libations, and soak it all up  
OL,20, with a fish supper, what's the thread?

OL,6, Overindulgence, probably. But besides  
OL,7, that? Entertainment machines. Not the  
OL,8, typical Pacman and Space Invaders, no, 
OL,9, those are far too often discussed.     
OL,11, For the man who knows all after a few  
OL,12, light ales, there's the quiz machine.  
OL,13, All the fun of a pub quiz but on any   
OL,14, night of the week.                     
OL,16, You're only quizzing against the quiz  
OL,17, machine too, so nobody else to pip you 
OL,18, to winning the prize. Even if the prize
OL,19, is barely a refund for the fiver you   
OL,20, stuck in the machine to begin with...

OL,6, If you're not the trivia-minded type,

OL,8, the slot machine.

OL,11, otherwise, but there's nothing quite as
OL,12, thrilling as, er, feeding a tenner into

OL,15, It's a mildly entertaining shredder, at
OL,16,Gleast as long as it's got good gameplay
OL,17,Gand perhaps features a number of famous
OL,18,Gcharacter quotes from TV shows now long
OL,19, since expired. But it's still a bit of

OL,6, For the more energetic (though perhaps 
OL,7, in recent times most disappointed) fans
OL,8, of the electronic (or mechanical) cash-
OL,9, hole genre, the pinball machine.       
OL,11, Ping, bing, bing, clunk, kching, etc.  
OL,12, Much like the others, there's question 
OL,13, over whether it's skill or luck, but   
OL,14, if you want to see if you can still see
OL,15, straight enough to follow a small shiny
OL,16,Gthing around between a lot of pulsating

OL,6, Still, regardless of their money hunger
OL,7, and questionable value, for a couple of
OL,8, generations they've been part of the   
OL,9, furniture in pubs, clubs, chip shops,  
OL,10, and if you're so inclined, arcades.    
OL,12, That's a good 70 years or so worth of  
OL,13, machines in various electromechanical  
OL,14, ratios and with their eye-catching art 
OL,15, and audiovisual effects. Worth saving,
