OL,6, What day is it? What year? Pardon my   
OL,7, confusion, I'm aware I sound as though 
OL,8, I'm doing an amateur production of Life
OL,9, on Mars, but I forget these things.    
OL,11, I've been thinking for the better part 
OL,12, of 20 years that nothing really stands 
OL,13, out as representing the 00s, or indeed 
OL,14, the 10s, and that everything becomes   
OL,15, obvious in hindsight. But it hasn't.   
OL,17, The 1990s are still the previous decade
OL,18, and the 21st century has yet to prove  
OL,19, itself worthy of an identity inside my 
OL,20, head.

OL,6, I mean, where's our ball chair? Where's
OL,7, our inflatable chair? Where's our drab 
OL,8, floral pattern sofa, or our striped    
OL,9, brown... everything? Our assortment of 
OL,10, abstract brightly coloured shapes on   
OL,11, things? Where's our inflatable chair?  
OL,13, Ok, I said that last one twice, but it 
OL,14, came back around in the 90s.           
OL,16, But there just doesn't seem to be much 
OL,17, of an identity to the post-90s world,  
OL,18, does there? It's like somebody just    
OL,19, sort of forgot to turn the 90s off and 
OL,20, it's slowly running down its batteries.

OL,6, Fashion, too. Where's our punk, brown  
OL,7, cord trousers, neon leg warmers, or... 
OL,8, actually, what did the 90s have that   
OL,9, we don't? Maybe fashion just sort of   
OL,10, fizzled out in the mid 90s and I didn't
OL,11, notice.                                
OL,13, Am I just a miserable old git with no  
OL,14, sense of the hot new flavours? No, it's
OL,15, the children who are wrong. Yes, I do  
OL,16, still reference The Simpsons. Perhaps  
OL,17, I'm starting to see the problem.       
OL,19, I still don't see what we're doing new 
OL,20, though, culture or counterculture.

OL,6, You'd think with a keen interest in    
OL,7, archaic media that I'd enjoy thinking  
OL,8, that it's still basically the 90s as   
OL,9, far as culture is concerned, but you   
OL,10, can't really appreciate nostalgia until
OL,11, it's gone. It just doesn't really feel 
OL,12, like a peek into the past any more when
OL,13, we still seem to be wallowing in the   
OL,14, remnants of the 90s (and apparently a  
OL,15, bit of an 80s revival).                
OL,17, I'll have to make do with Noel's House 
OL,18, Party, because what's more out of place
OL,19, than a bloke who dresses like an out of
OL,20, touch Aussie father at a family BBQ?
