OL,6, What's all this obsession with thinness
OL,7, about? No, not supermodels, technology.
OL,8, Wafer thin phones, tablets, laptops and
OL,9, such. I mention it because I remember  
OL,10, when I were a lad we had equipment in  
OL,11, school that could've probably survived 
OL,12, even the most careless of pupil - or   
OL,13, teacher, for that matter.              
OL,15, In an age where we seem to like giving 
OL,16, children iPads and whatnot to work on, 
OL,17, spare a thought for the old workhorses 
OL,18, of days gone by.

OL,6, The overhead projector, for example. A 
OL,7, rugged bit of kit, built for one job.  
OL,8, Take this see-through sheet of plastic 
OL,9, and splatter the beige wall with its   
OL,10, contents. Simple enough. A lightbulb,  
OL,11, a couple of lenses, a mirror, and a big
OL,12, steel box and, come to think of it, a  
OL,13, bit of steel box for the arm.          
OL,15, Ok, so it had some glass in it, that's 
OL,16, not 100% foolproof. But it was robust  
OL,17, and lacked the irreparable complexity  
OL,18, of a modern projector. When's the last 
OL,19, time you saw someone actually use one  
OL,20, of those "smartboards" properly anyway?

OL,6, Maybe that was a bad example. How about
OL,7, the BBC Micro? Computer for the ages.  
OL,8, Well, ages 5 to 16 or so, at least in  
OL,9, the 80s.                               
OL,11, Anyway, a big lump of a computer, maybe
OL,12, not by PC standards, but its peers were
OL,13, often more svelte. Take the ZX Spectrum
OL,14, with its diminutive keyboard that was  
OL,15, like... ok, no, sorry, I'm being trite,
OL,16, everybody's insulted the poor thing's  
OL,17, keyboard by now. Anyway, the rugged and
OL,18, portly Beeb was built to withstand the 
OL,19, ever-present threat of two dozen kids  
OL,20, with all the finesse of a jackhammer.

OL,6, Lest we forget the erstwhile mainstay  
OL,7, of the classroom audio toolkit, the    
OL,8, Coomber tape deck. No messing about,   
OL,9, it plays tapes and it's not going to   
OL,10, take any of your messing about. Solid  
OL,11, clunky buttons, quarter inch headphone 
OL,12, sockets, big twiddly knobs. Possibly   
OL,13, also a 2-pin DIN plug for a big speaker
OL,14, in the hall. While we're on the subject
OL,15, we might as well give a nod to the big 
OL,16, woodgrain telly on wheels, accompanied 
OL,17, but a VHS deck the size of a microwave 
OL,18, and a similarly oversized Betamax deck 
OL,19, the technician never bothered to remove
OL,20, from the trolley.

OL,6, I come to the part where I usually take
OL,7, a moment to consider whether what I'm  
OL,8, writing has a point.                   
OL,10, It doesn't really, other than to lament
OL,11, the loss of such classroom technology  
OL,12, icons, the likes of which could come   
OL,13, out the other end of a car crusher     
OL,14, laughing at you and asking "is that all
OL,15, you've got? I spent my life in Class 4B
OL,16, and if you reckon I'm going to get all 
OL,17, smashed up by this thing then you're   
OL,18, clearly mistaken". Was it better? Not  
OL,19, really, there's a lot a modern computer
OL,20, can do, but it's not the same, is it?
