OL,5, So, Nestle. Rowntree's. Mars. Cadbury. 
OL,6, Yes, you lot. What's your game, eh?    
OL,8, Did someone appoint you the teacher of 
OL,9, disappointment or do you just enjoy    
OL,10, hoiking kids' enjoyment of your sweets 
OL,11, away?                                  
OL,13, Where's my Citrus Blast Polos gone?"   
OL,15, The secondary school vending machine   
OL,16, used to have them, so as a result I did
OL,17, too. How am I supposed to wax nostalgic
OL,18, when you keep revoking my tasty aides  
OL,19, to memory?

OL,5, Cadbury? Where's my Astros gone? I was 
OL,6, quite happily sitting in front of Robot
OL,7, Wars on BBC2 munching on those and now 
OL,8, all of a sudden I'm an old git sitting 
OL,9, here with neither Robot Wars or Astros.
OL,11, I'm blaming you. It's all your fault.  
OL,13, It's not just sweets either. Walkers,  
OL,14, you're not getting off that easily.    
OL,15, Where did you put my Doritos 3Ds? You  
OL,16, see, I can't enjoy the Cherryade Panda 
OL,17, Pop burning my gums without abrading   
OL,18, them with inconveniently-shaped corn   
OL,19, snacks.

OL,5, It's just not on, is it? You release a 
OL,6, product full of addictive brain-sucking
OL,7, sugary goodness for just long enough to
OL,8, get people hooked and then you force us
OL,9, to experience withdrawal. It's a sick  
OL,10, game you play.                         
OL,12, It's disgusting. It should be illegal, 
OL,13, toying with peoples' emotions like that
OL,14, and wrenching away what made their     
OL,15, childhoods.                            
OL,17, Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to  
OL,18, go and have a can of Tizer Ice to chill
OL,19, out. Wait, they've done what? Oh god!
