OL,6, Fancy a toasty? 'Course you do, who    
OL,7, doesn't? But you'll not bother making  
OL,8, one, because it's such a faff.         
OL,10, That's why your toasty maker's either  
OL,11, sitting in the cupboard breeding other 
OL,12, appliances or you flogged it or chucked
OL,13, it out yonks ago.                      
OL,15, How do they do it, eh? Those appliance 
OL,16, makers, just an ad on the telly or a   
OL,17, tasteful product shot in the Argos book
OL,18, and suddenly buying another 30 quid bit
OL,19, of plastic that'll revolutionise your  
OL,20, life seems like an excellent purchase!

OL,6, They're all there, I'll bet you've even
OL,7, got a cupboard you don't even open just
OL,8, because there's nothing in there but   
OL,9, piles of kitchen gadgets that'll pour  
OL,10, out onto the floor if you do.          
OL,12, Toasty maker, mixer, blender, chopper, 
OL,13, juicer, bread maker, scale, Teasmade...
OL,15, You could probably assemble an ad-hoc  
OL,16, science lab with all that.             
OL,18, Who's got the worktop space to use them
OL,19, even if they weren't stashed in a box  
OL,20, anyway? So why not get rid of them?

OL,6, Because the moment you do, you'll think
OL,7, you've done a great job of clearing out
OL,8, the kitchen, right up until 3 days time
OL,9, when all of a sudden you've got a huge 
OL,10, craving for a ham and cheese toasty,   
OL,11, the likes of which have only ever been 
OL,12, experienced by a hardcore drug user.   
OL,14, Then you'll think it seems like a great
OL,15, idea to go and buy a new one. The old  
OL,16,Gone was a bit crusty anyway, that's why
OL,17,Gyou never used it. Honest.             
OL,18,G                                       
OL,19, So go on, have a toasty, exercise that 
OL,20, toasty maker. You know you want to.
