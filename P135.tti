OL,5, Isn't it funny, put a bit of foil on a 
OL,6, bit of paper and suddenly it really    
OL,7, means something. Money, passport, 1997 
OL,8, season Ryan Giggs shiny.               
OL,10, Getting kids to collect useless bits of
OL,11, cardboard seems dead easy, you just    
OL,12, tell them it's rare and stick their    
OL,13, favourite famous stuff on the front.   
OL,14, Cards, stickers, POGs, even literally  
OL,15, just bits of foil if you could con your
OL,16, mates into thinking it was cool.       
OL,18, Wonder if I could've been a Richard    
OL,19, Branson if I'd just peeled off a load  
OL,20, of 'warranty void if removed' stickers.

OL,5, I'm starting to wonder if I have a     
OL,6, point in all this. Perhaps you are too.
OL,7, Maybe it's that if your kid asks for a 
OL,8, packet of stickers, it might not be a  
OL,9, terrible idea to let them have them. In
OL,10, our day we collected all manner of     
OL,11, useless, cheap, tacky, over-advertised,
OL,12, gimmicky, pointless, expensive...      
OL,15, ...what I mean to say is to afford your
OL,16, child a fleeting moment of joy in the  
OL,17, harshness that we inhabit... just dig  
OL,18, out your old box of crap. 80p? For a   
OL,19, bit of paper? Daylight robbery! Why,   
OL,20, back in my day...
