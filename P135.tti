OL,9, just do our marketing for us..."       
OL,11, "...Hello? Hello...?"                  
OL,13, Hm, a change in approach, perhaps. How 
OL,14, about we just give people stickers with
OL,15, our logo on to put in their car window?
OL,17, Nah, that'll never work, surely? Who'd 
OL,18, fall for that?                         
OL,20, Turns out, quite a lot of people.

OL,6, Funny thing, isn't it? As long as you  
OL,7, frame your free marketing as a gift,   
OL,8, suddenly people are perfectly willing  
OL,9, to promote you for no reason or reward.
OL,11, I'd be surprised if radio stations in  
OL,12, the 80s and 90s ever spent a penny on  
OL,13, advertising that wasn't a printed sheet
OL,14, of car window stickers.                
OL,16, I suppose people wised up eventually,  
OL,17, you don't seem to see them nearly as   
OL,18, much these days. Perhaps they were just
OL,19, tired of trying to remove stubborn ones
OL,20, from windows.

OL,6, As long as it's a free sticker, or pen,
OL,7, or little fuzzy bug with a logo on its 
OL,8, tail, then it's cool. What did anybody 
OL,9, do with those fuzzy bugs anyway? Having
OL,10, picked them up from stalls and stands, 
OL,11, I've absolutely no idea what became of 
OL,12, them other than landfill. Oh well.     
OL,14, For your free SPARK car sticker...
