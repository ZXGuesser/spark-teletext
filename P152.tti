OL,6, You know, Andy Warhol once said "In the
OL,7, future, everyone will be world-famous  
OL,8, for 15 minutes". Though I very much    
OL,9, doubt he had the explosion of reality  
OL,10, television in mind when he wrote that. 
OL,11, In my opinion, Big Brother was the     
OL,12, original monster that threw ordinary   
OL,13, joe soaps into the public spotlight for
OL,14, more than 15 minutes.                  
OL,16, And now it seems that Love Island is   
OL,17, doing the same thing except with more  
OL,18, ways for those who take the step away  
OL,19, from anonymity to cash in on their     
OL,20, 'celebrity' status.

OL,6, Love Island, if you don't know, is     
OL,7, basically Big Brother with the added   
OL,8, dimension of the 'Islanders' required  
OL,9, to couple up with each other while     
OL,10, living literally in each other's       
OL,11, pockets in a villa in sunny Spain. The 
OL,12, most loved couple, as voted for by the 
OL,13, public, wins a share of up to #50,000. 
OL,15, It was originally a celebrity dating   
OL,16, game from 2004 to 2006 (ish) but has   
OL,17, EXPLODED in popularity since being     
OL,18, revived in 2015. But what kind of      
OL,19, impact does being on a show like it    
OL,20, have on your life in the age of Social 
OL,21, Media?

OL,6, Well... It's like a nuke being dropped 
OL,7, and creating a mushroom cloud of       
OL,8, monetary security. Suddenly, what was  
OL,9, casual Instagramming becomes a         
OL,10, potential goldmine equivalent to       
OL,11, winning an instant fortune on the Lotto
OL,12, (like that will ever happen to 99% of  
OL,13, us).                                   
OL,15, Social Media followings skyrocket and  
OL,16, people's eyes become glued to your     
OL,17, every word and action as couples formed
OL,18, in the Villa take their life back to   
OL,19, the real world.

OL,6, Companies and brands also begin        
OL,7, offering you money in exchange for work
OL,8, in Influencer Marketing which, in      
OL,9, theory, means using people or          
OL,10, organisations with a vast knowledge or 
OL,11, social influence to advertise products 
OL,12, by way of endorsements or testimonials.
OL,14, It's a lucrative big business when the 
OL,15, popularity of people like Love         
OL,16, Islanders is as hot as a meteor but    
OL,17, let's be realistic, would I really use 
OL,18, the thoughts of someone who went from  
OL,19, nobody to somebody in eight weeks to   
OL,20, decide whether or not I buy a product?

OL,6, I don't think so since the only bit of 
OL,7, reputation these people have is living 
OL,8, in a villa in Spain for so many weeks  
OL,9, and either being the hero or villain of
OL,10, their many relationships. But then     
OL,11, again, that's just how I see this kind 
OL,12, of thing which certainly is becoming a 
OL,13, must-have tool in any company's        
OL,14, marketing toolkit.                     
OL,16, However, while fame and fortune can    
OL,17, open many tremendous opportunities, it 
OL,18, can be equally traumatic for those who 
OL,19, aren't mentally prepared to handle the 
OL,20, burden that comes with trudging through
OL,21, the thunderstorm of popularity that    
OL,22, greets those lucky enough to be caught 
OL,23, up in it.

OL,6, Just ask the two former islanders      
OL,7, pushed over the edge earlier this year.
OL,8, Sophie Gradon from the 2016 Series and 
OL,9, Mike Thalassitis from the 2017 series  
OL,10, both committed suicide which shocked   
OL,11, the nation.                            
OL,13, I was also shocked at how something    
OL,14, like being on a show like Love Island  
OL,15, could make people do things like       
OL,16, this. Although,I would probably find   
OL,17, the impact of that metaphorical nuke   
OL,18, too much to take too and not just      
OL,19, because I have autism.

OL,6, To summarise, the age of Social Media  
OL,7, has certainly found new ways for people
OL,8, to have their fifteen minutes of fame, 
OL,9, new ways for businesses to advertise   
OL,10, and attract customers and new ways for 
OL,11, television shows to reach their        
OL,12, audiences and turn people into stars.  
OL,14, However, people should remember that   
OL,15, the contestants who go on these shows  
OL,16, don't really expect what comes next;   
OL,17, that these Islanders are humans too;   
OL,18, and that if you really want to be      
OL,19, famous, you need to have a thick skin  
OL,20, and a personality that can give as good
OL,21, as its gets when the age of Social     
OL,22, Media turns you in something bigger    
OL,23, than what you imagined it to be.
