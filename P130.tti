OL,6, It all depends on the mix of           
OL,7, 'celebrities' of course, creating      
OL,8, chemistry being essential to its       
OL,9, success. This year of course, Covid has
OL,10, meant that the usual Australian        
OL,11, location was out of the question.      
OL,13, Ironically, now I have been watching   
OL,14,Gsome (not all) of the new series, I    
OL,15, think this is the biggest favour to the
OL,16, show's future!                         
OL,18, The enforced change to use a castle in 
OL,19, Wales has been a shot in the arm       
OL,20, (pardon the vaccine mention!) and      
OL,21, reinvigorated!

OL,6,GI have to admit to having a few doubts 
OL,7, at first - was that voice a bit too    
OL,8, comical, is she just too attractive for
OL,9,Gthis role? Is she gurning a bit too    
OL,10, much in that scene?                    
OL,12,GMy reservations did melt away, like the
OL,13,Grest of the cast her scenes have proven
OL,14, to be a triumph. The chemistry between 
OL,15, these actors and the stories explored  
OL,16, have me gripped! I can't wait for      
OL,17,Gseries five and suspect I will have to 
OL,18,Grewatch the entire lot soon! Enjoy!

OL,6,GThese bite sized episodes are ripe for 
OL,7,Gbinging, following the cast of the     
OL,8, first UK series as they tour the       
OL,9, country.                               
OL,11, It's hilarious fun and even better for 
OL,12,Gthe fact that they are joined by US    
OL,13, alumni Alyssa Edwards, who is always of
OL,14, great value in the laughter stakes!    
OL,15, One quality that's always found in     
OL,16,Gshows like this is heart - in the midst
OL,17, of the one liners, the silliness and   
OL,18, the camp shenanigans... there is real  
OL,19, heart and love and affection for one   
OL,20, another. It's a show that will leave   
OL,21, you smiling for many reasons, something
OL,22, heartwarming for lockdown!
