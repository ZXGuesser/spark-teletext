OL,13, It's all peppered with brilliant lines,

OL,6,GThis week saw the conclusion - please  
OL,7,GLord let it be the conclusion - to Mick
OL,8, Carter's childhood abuse storyline.    
OL,10,GIt's been a long road - and a plot that
OL,11,Gserved a purpose and had value, but was
OL,12,Gdragged out and if I'd seen Danny      
OL,13,GDyer's character narrow his eyes and   
OL,14, stare from doorways one more time...   
OL,16, In the end, justice was served well,   
OL,17,Geverything was neatly wrapped up, Mick 
OL,18,Gloved his family and embraced his      
OL,19, daughters, as the show's special

OL,8, equal measure,CThe Eurovision Song

OL,12,GThis entertainment juggernaut was in   
OL,13, Rotterdam, Netherlands, this year and  
OL,14, the spectacle was immense! It was a    
OL,15, really impressive display and a        
OL,16, logistical miracle - as Graham Norton  
OL,17, pointed out, in a country that isn't   
OL,18, coming out of lockdown as the UK is    
OL,19, just yet.

OL,6,GAside from this achievement, the 65th  
OL,7, contest had all the hallmarks of       
OL,8, tradition - bizarre songs and singers, 
OL,9,Ghilarious moments with both hosts and  
OL,10, judging representatives.               
OL,12, For me, the real fun starts with the

OL,14,Grunning through 39 countries judging
