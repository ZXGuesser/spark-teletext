OL,6, Of course, I naturally admire a man who
OL,7, can make a good living for years from  
OL,8, watching telly and making witty        
OL,9, observations (I can dream, eh!).       
OL,11, His return - and to the BBC, a new home
OL,12, - brings back his much needed style,   
OL,13, with a new theme each week inCHarry    
OL,14,CHill's World of TV.                    
OL,16, The first episode was about soap       
OL,17, operas, with some fantastically silly  
OL,18, moments from the likes of Crossroads   
OL,19, with its wobbly sets and skilled       
OL,20, editing of clips with wildly ridiculous
OL,21, dramatic moments.

OL,6, Some valid points too - how crazy it is
OL,7, that Coronation Street has gone from   
OL,8, the biggest drama being Ken Barlow     
OL,9, knocking a glass off the bar in the    
OL,10, Rovers, through to a tram crashing off 
OL,11, the viaduct and squashing Rita under   
OL,12, pick 'n' mix!                          
OL,14, Harry really is a comedy genius, tying 
OL,15, together clips for effect that you and 
OL,16, I would have never thought of. Genius. 
OL,18, Still on soap,CEastEnders: Secrets From
OL,19,CThe SquareGhas helped plugged the      
OL,20, gaping chasm in our lives (!) since the

OL,6, They've given a new angle to the show, 
OL,7, we never get to see anything of the    
OL,8, behind the scenes as a rule, and in

OL,6,GThere were the usual talking heads     
OL,7, style sound bites, a huge variety of   
OL,8, them in fact (no doubt many are        
OL,9, available for video calls in the past  
OL,10, few months!).                          
OL,12, A comforting, although some might say  
OL,13, stale and tired, format that combines  
OL,14, these interviews with classic clips and
OL,15, tales about each actor involved.       
OL,17, A line or two from Mollie Sugden is all
OL,18, it takes to please me, to be honest - I
OL,19, still laugh as much as the first time!
