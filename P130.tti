OL,6, It's a story many of us already know,  
OL,7, because he never shied away from       
OL,8, publicity after his arrest.            
OL,10, Yet, like many such horrors, it always 
OL,11, holds a certain fascination.           
OL,13, 'Call me Des' - creepy as hell, but you
OL,14,Gcan't take your eyes off him.          
OL,16, Responsible for unspeakable acts and   
OL,17, snuffing out lives, yet here we are    
OL,18, intrigued enough to produce a three    
OL,19, part primetime show!

OL,6, Great cast as well as Tennant too -    
OL,7, Daniel Mays and Jason Watkins amongst  
OL,8, others, actors who may not be the      
OL,9, headliners, but always impress!

OL,6, This socially distanced studio setup   
OL,7, worked quite well, with a bank of      
OL,8,Gscreens filled with those questioning -
OL,9, a bit like 'Celebrity Squares', but    
OL,10, without the celebs.. and only, er,     
OL,11, squares.                               
OL,13,GSome barking mad moments, questions    
OL,14,Gbeing dodged, egos rising and in some  
OL,15, ways the programme serves purpose and  
OL,16, is a platform.                         
OL,18,GYet, at the same time, it goes nowhere 
OL,19, but in circles and frustrates

OL,6,CGoggleboxGhas been back a couple of    
OL,7, weeks and I admit, I cannot get enough 
OL,8, of it! It's comforting to see them     
OL,9, again - Dave and Shirley, Giles and    
OL,10, Mary (always my favourites) and many   
OL,11, others who we have welcomed into our   
OL,12,Gfront rooms - as they watch telly in   
OL,13,Gtheirs.                                
OL,15, The celebrity version was a joy (and   
OL,16, reviewed on these very pages           
OL,17, previously), but this original version 
OL,18, creates stars out of everyday box

OL,7,GJenny and Lee's innuendo laden caravan 
OL,8, exploits, Giles and Mary bickering in  
OL,9, such a comical way, whilst reviewing   
OL,10, the likes of Des.                      
OL,12, This week the Malones and Siddiquis    
OL,13, were discussing Michael Gove's tie and 
OL,14, forehead on BBC Breakfast, someone I   
OL,15, love to see mocked.

OL,18, be running for decades to come, in     
OL,19, theory. They never get bored of telly -
OL,20, and I have never got bored with them!
