OL,11, you're on the TVARK site, recall the   
OL,12, previous incarnation of Sky Arts back  
OL,13, in the 90s.

OL,15,GThe channel has had quite a journey.   
OL,16,GBack then, Sky was probably what you   
OL,17,Gcould call brasher and more tabloid    
OL,18, than it is now. The channel was the    
OL,19,Gdiamond in the rough - home of opera,  
OL,20, ballet, documentary and many highbrow  
OL,21, discussions.

OL,6, Then, along came BSB, with it's NOW    
OL,7, hybrid arts and current affairs        
OL,8, channel.                               
OL,10, I was a huge fan of BSB, yet didn't    
OL,11, even have access - I nagged and pleaded
OL,12, with my poor parents to have a         
OL,13, 'squarial' on the side of the house.   
OL,14,G                                       
OL,15, 'Nope, too expensive - there's enough  
OL,16, rubbish on the regular telly!'         
OL,18, By the time I could pay for it myself, 
OL,19, BSkyB had already come into being and  
OL,20, NOW had merged into Sky Arts and then  
OL,21, ultimately faded away.

OL,6, Reboots are commonplace these days     
OL,7, though and Sky Arts returned and is now
OL,8, highly thought of and a channel of     
OL,9, quality content - personally, I love it
OL,10, and enjoy plenty of their programming. 
OL,12,CSky Arts LateGproved a success - taking
OL,13, place this week in the Stratford       
OL,14, Theatre Royal - a beautiful venue and  
OL,15, perfect for the performances and debate

OL,6, In a time that is heartbreakingly      
OL,7, difficult for the arts, it was         
OL,8,Grefreshing to see a versatile approach 
OL,9, to such a show, bouncing around ideas

OL,12, so, in the week that Picturehouse

OL,6,GAmazing how many are unhappy about     
OL,7, this, quoting that they pay their      
OL,8, licence fee! It's made for ITV... and  
OL,9,Gin the next breath, they are probably  
OL,10, saying elsewhere that they want to     
OL,11, scrap the licence fee!

OL,14, youth, I was absolutely hooked to the  
OL,15, point of obsession!                    
OL,17, It's return could have been a disaster,
OL,18, even though it is the perfect time with
OL,19, today's public figures as perfect      
OL,20, material.

OL,6,GIf the first two episodes are anything 
OL,7,Gto go by, it should be a triumphant    
OL,8, return. Some clever skits about Boris  
OL,9, Johnson and Donald Trump were          
OL,10, entertaining. Also, excellent scenarios
OL,11, such as Priti Patel as an S&M mistress,
OL,12, with Michael Gove her next subservient 
OL,13, slave!                                 
OL,15, I'm hoping it continues in this way and
OL,16,GI wonder how many extra viewers this is
OL,17, bringing to Britbox - which is rather a
OL,18, nice service, on the surface it gives  
OL,19, folk the impression it's standard      
OL,20, repeats. However, there are gems here  
OL,21, that will never be repeated I'm sure,  
OL,22, something for every nostalgic fan.

OL,7,Gearlier in the year, some A listers    
OL,8, more than willing to take part on video
OL,9, calls from their homes.                
OL,11, Now, the celeb fest returns to the old 
OL,12, format - almost! Guests are distanced  
OL,13, in the studio and the audience is      
OL,14, limited in number and also mask        
OL,15, wearing.

OL,17, Plus, music performance is back on     
OL,18, stage, wonderful to see this on the    
OL,19, telly again! The combination of guests 
OL,20, always seems to be well planned and    
OL,21, with chemistry that works really well.
