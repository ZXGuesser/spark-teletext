OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G1/7
OL,6, This week's telly: Fred & Rose West -  
OL,7, The Search For Victims - Channel 5; The
OL,8, Hotel Inspector - Channel 5; Boy George
OL,9, & Culture Club - Karma to Calamity -   
OL,10, BBC4                                   
OL,12, Channel 5 has long been the home of the
OL,13, long form documentary - whether it's   
OL,14, some kind of body horror, something    
OL,15, sexual or something that involves Jane 
OL,16, McDonald warbling on a boat, we know   
OL,17, what we're getting these days!         
OL,19, We also get a weekly Royal documentary,
OL,20, which is certainly an almost guilty    
OL,21, pleasure of mine!

OL,6, They're something I have often reviewed
OL,7, here...and let's not forget the serial 
OL,8, killer stories!                        
OL,10, Fred & Rose - The Search For Victims   
OL,11, has been triggered by the recent       
OL,12, investigation that proved fruitless,   
OL,13, attempting to find further remains.    
OL,15, Giving us two nights of a total three  
OL,16, hours of programming, it's amazing that
OL,17, there is still more to be said about   
OL,18, the Cromwell Street couple.            
OL,20, I think it's such a complex, in depth  
OL,21, and horrifying case.

OL,6, For those reasons, there are always    
OL,7, details to be relayed, accounts to be  
OL,8, shared, information that attempts to   
OL,9, help us make sense of something,       
OL,10, anything!                              
OL,12, How do you ever make sense of this, two
OL,13, people embodying evil, who murdered    
OL,14, their own daughter too? Yet, it is     
OL,15, fascinating, always a study of human   
OL,16, nature and the truly terrible people   
OL,17, who sometimes live amongst us.         
OL,19, Rose lives on of course, almost a      
OL,20, mythical figure, something that she    
OL,21, probably loves and feeds her ego.

OL,6, There's also an argument for continuing
OL,7, to discuss these cases, if it means    
OL,8, that we can all be more vigilant and   
OL,9, stop it happening again.               
OL,11, Something we haven't stopped happening 
OL,12, again is The Hotel Inspector producing 
OL,13, another series - and I for one am very 
OL,14, pleased! Each year now, I feel sure    
OL,15, there won't be another, and am then    
OL,16, over the moon to see new episodes of   
OL,17, Alex Polizzi's no nonsense style.      
OL,19, Of course, this year's series looks    
OL,20, back at the impact of the first Covid  
OL,21, lockdown.

OL,6, Polizzi travelled to a Dorset pub/hotel
OL,7, that had to be seen to be believed, one
OL,8, of the worst she has ever visited.     
OL,10, The couple running it were essentially 
OL,11, Wayne and Waynetta Slob, with less     
OL,12, personality. Unkempt, unwashed,        
OL,13, unwittingly without any hospitality    
OL,14, skills whatsoever!                     
OL,16, As Alex herself said, they were the    
OL,17, problem - not even the locals would pop
OL,18, by for a drink. This was before        
OL,19, tackling the issue of the garden being 
OL,20, a junkyard, the rooms looking shabby   
OL,21, and the whole unwelcoming style.

OL,6, It was one of her biggest challenges   
OL,7, yet - very entertaining, and I cannot  
OL,8, wait to see more!                      
OL,10, Boy George and Culture Club: Karma to  
OL,11, Calamity is a documentary I've actually
OL,12, seen before, but a welcome reshowing in
OL,13, BBC4's Friday night music strand.      
OL,15, It follows a reunion for the band, with
OL,16, a new concert tour and accompanying    
OL,17, album to boot. In typical band doc     
OL,18, style, we see those behind the scenes  
OL,19, moments as they enter stage right, the 
OL,20, family moments, the things that have   
OL,21, changed for them since their 80s rise.

OL,6, I've always been a fan - and of Boy    
OL,7, George as a personality. His light has 
OL,8, never dimmed, he's a bit of a force of 
OL,9, nature and you can tell watching this  
OL,10, that he has the power to really light  
OL,11, the blue touch paper.                  
OL,13, I doubt it was all him though, Jon Moss
OL,14, comes across as mellowed - as they all 
OL,15, do - but there's still that sharpness  
OL,16, there. It still, to this day, seems a  
OL,17, bit of a toxic mix! Sweet and sour,    
OL,18, love and hate - and it never quite     
OL,19, works out. It certainly makes for      
OL,20, entertaining viewing though!
