OL,6, This week's telly: GB News launch week;
OL,7, Celebrity Gogglebox - Channel 4; Euro  
OL,8, 2020 - BBC1 and ITV                    
OL,10, Being a lifelong telly fan - and also  
OL,11, quite geeky when it comes to new       
OL,12, channels, TV branding and the like - I 
OL,13, was inevitably getting quite excited by
OL,14, the impending launch of GB News.       
OL,16, I already knew that the content and    
OL,17, tone were not going to be to my liking.
OL,18, However, based purely on personality, I
OL,19, do like Andrew Neil. I always enjoyed  
OL,20, his combative interview style,         
OL,21, seemingly more effective than some.

OL,6, He had a way, when at the BBC, of not  
OL,7, giving up on politicians' diversion    
OL,8, techniques, but in a way that appealed 
OL,9, and was entertainingly no nonsense.    
OL,11, Knowing that he was chairman of and a  
OL,12, lead presenter for GB News inspired    
OL,13, confidence. As did their poaching of   
OL,14, personalities such as Simon McCoy,     
OL,15, Kirsty Gallacher and Alastair Stewart. 
OL,16, Seeming to be a strong line up to start
OL,17, with!                                  
OL,19, What wasn't quite as strong was the    
OL,20, launch budget - way, way below the BBC 
OL,21, and Sky News - yet wanting to compete.

OL,6, Compete for both audience figures and  
OL,7, the hearts and minds of many. Yet the  
OL,8, agenda was also to appeal to those who 
OL,9, feel sidelined by BBC and Sky News, who
OL,10, don't have a voice with accusations of 
OL,11, London centric focus.                  
OL,13, Appealing to the Fox News style gang,  
OL,14, the pre-launch publicity had the right 
OL,15, people excited and frothing at the     
OL,16, mouth, with the prospect of strong     
OL,17, opinion, wild debate and NOT being     
OL,18, impartial - fighting against the so-   
OL,19, called BBC bias (to this day, not one  
OL,20, person has given me a concrete example 
OL,21, of this bias in action).

OL,6, The countdown was over on Sunday at 8pm
OL,7, - GB News launched with an intro show  
OL,8, hosted by Andrew Neil, proudly         
OL,9, announcing their ethos and points of   
OL,10, difference.                            
OL,12, It's different alright! At the risk of 
OL,13, sounding like a total shooting down in 
OL,14, flames, the first week has been beset  
OL,15, with difficulties - sound issues from  
OL,16, show one, a very dark looking decor in 
OL,17, the studio - a design that doesn't seem
OL,18, to know where it's coming from.        
OL,20, Presenters talking over each other,    
OL,21, microphones failing, links failing.

OL,6, We heard people commenting off camera  
OL,7, over the top of a weather forecast and 
OL,8, other gaffes - and this was before     
OL,9, advertisers began pulling out, some    
OL,10, brands not even aware that their       
OL,11, agencies had placed them in bulk buy   
OL,12, airtime.                               
OL,14, Is this a disaster? Is GB News doomed  
OL,15, already? Watch this space, I feel the  
OL,16, tech issues will be solve, we have to  
OL,17, give them some slack to sort those out.
OL,18, Lower budget may be tricky - even if   
OL,19, you pitch yourself as a channel built  
OL,20, on people sitting around debating - can
OL,21, that really be sustained long term?

OL,6, Yet, part of me feels it has a place in
OL,7, the telly landscape. I've dipped in and
OL,8, out - today I am watching 'Alastair    
OL,9, Stewart and Friends' - he's having a   
OL,10, lovely time of it, clearly elated, and 
OL,11, it's actually proving to be quite an   
OL,12, entertaining mix of items! It gives me 
OL,13, hope yet, GB News!                     
OL,15, Celebrity Gogglebox is always welcome  
OL,16, back to Channel 4, a real lynchpin in  
OL,17, the schedules now - although I am      
OL,18, missing Rylan and his even funnier Mum!
OL,20, Denise Van Outen and her hubby are     
OL,21, proving a fun duo!
