OL,6,GSpoiler alert (although you really     
OL,7,Gshould have watched by now, tut!) - I  
OL,8,Gwas so excited, I had my own theories  
OL,9, that it was the Chief Constable or     
OL,10, Thurlwell. After all, why would they   
OL,11, have James Nesbitt's photo and not have
OL,12, him appear in person.                  
OL,14, Guess what?! He did not appear! It was 
OL,15,Gprobably the Chief above the fourth man
OL,16,Gpulling the strings! However, Brummie  
OL,17,GBuckles was H! And there was more to   
OL,18, come, but it all wrapped up with a huge
OL,19, anti-climax.

OL,6,GThis is hugely disappointing for the   
OL,7,Gcommitted audience, especially if there
OL,8, really won't be a series seven!        
OL,10,GYet part of me respects Jed Mercurio's 
OL,11,Gplot, like David Lynch he won't just   
OL,12,Ggive the audience a neatly wrapped up  
OL,13,Gending, nor answer all questions. Real 
OL,14, life corruption does not always get    
OL,15, found out, it continues and is swept   
OL,16, under the carpet - and I guess he's    
OL,17,Gtrying to reflect that. Still made me

OL,6,GI'm already enjoying repeats of The    
OL,7,GGood Life on Gold right now and this   
OL,8, was a sitcom I loved as a child.       
OL,9,G                                       
OL,10,GIt's a classic, with British class on  
OL,11, display in all its glory, Penelope     
OL,12,GKeith and Peter Bowles creating one of 
OL,13, the most memorable telly partnerships  
OL,14, and a real 'will they, won't they' tale
OL,15, that reached huge audience figures.    
OL,17, We often complain about repeats, but I 
OL,18, feel that ones of this standard are    
OL,19, welcome - in these strange days, they  
OL,20, are comforting, they wrap me in a warm 
OL,21, retro blanket.

OL,6,GNot so comforting right now is         
OL,7, Coronation Street. There aren't many   
OL,8, storylines that are a surprise these   
OL,9,Gdays, and there has been a lot of press
OL,10, around the upcoming attack storyline.  
OL,11, Based on true life events and raising  
OL,12, awareness - after Sophie Lancaster died
OL,13,Gfrom her injuries, following an attack 
OL,14,Gon her and her boyfriend, for nothing  
OL,15,Gmore than being dressed goth style.    
OL,17,GCorrie has handled such a tragedy very 
OL,18,Gsensitively and deftly. The episode    
OL,19,Gshowing an attack on Nina and her      
OL,20,Gboyfriend Seb was truly shocking and   
OL,21, upsetting.

OL,6,GThis is new Corrie, not something we   
OL,7, would have ever seen in the ITV3       
OL,8, classic episodes days - where currently
OL,9,GJack Duckworth giving up smoking is the
