OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA```````G2/5A`
OL,6,GIt can be argued that Edward saved the 
OL,7,GBritish monarchy. Following the late   
OL,8,Gresurgence in his mother's popularity, 
OL,9, there were frequent question marks over
OL,10, the institution's future.              
OL,12, His reign only lasted nine years, but  
OL,13, made an impact - Edwardian days of     
OL,14, extremes, with the lucky living the    
OL,15,Ghigh life ahead of what was to come    
OL,16,Gwith World War One. When you think     
OL,17,Gabout recent Royal scandals and the    
OL,18, breakdown of marriages, Edward remained
OL,19, married to Alexandra for many years,   
OL,20, yet there was a trail of mistresses    
OL,21, right up to his death.

OL,6,GThere's a lot to criticise of course,  
OL,7,Gbut this period helped secure the      
OL,8, monarchy's popularity with Georges V   
OL,9, and VI, paving the way for our Queen

OL,8, day - this little ray of sunshine

OL,16, Which is also true ofCThis Is Us.GA    
OL,17, recent recommendation, something that  
OL,18, has passed me by before - there's      
OL,19, already been five series of this drama 
OL,20, about the American Pearson family.

OL,6,GI am hooked already and it's sure to be
OL,7, a major binge watch for me. I'm totally
OL,8, invested in the characters, from       
OL,9,Gbuttoned up adopted son Randall,       
OL,10, through to the father Jack - whose     
OL,11, story is being cleverly told in        
OL,12, flashback scenes interspersed with his 
OL,13,Gkids' adult lives.                     
OL,14,G                                       
OL,15,GI can honestly say I have laughed and  
OL,16, shed a tear each and every episode -   
OL,17,Gyou'd have to have a heart of stone to 
OL,18,Gnot experience the same frankly!
