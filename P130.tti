OL,8,CBritain's Next Jewellery StarBBBC2G*

OL,11, Something that has obviously suffered  
OL,12, during the pandemic has been the film  
OL,13, industry. Personally speaking, I really
OL,14,Gmiss going to the cinema, something I  
OL,15,Gdid regularly - it's an experience that
OL,16,Gcan't be beaten in my eyes.            
OL,17,G                                       
OL,18, This of course means that fewer films  
OL,19, have been made, and those that have    
OL,20, transferred to streaming platforms. Why
OL,21, have an awards ceremony at all?

OL,6,GIt's debatable, but I guessCThe British
OL,7,CAcademy Film AwardsGis helping to keep 
OL,8,Geverything alive, ensuring mentions for
OL,9, those few films and those that are     
OL,10, ahead for the reopening of cinemas     
OL,11, soon.                                  
OL,13, In one sense, I welcome it, yet at the 
OL,14, same time it's a very lacklustre affair
OL,15,Gto see stars remotely accepting awards.
OL,16,G                                       
OL,17,GIntriguing to see them at home perhaps,
OL,18, but coupled with Dermot and Edith in a 
OL,19, deserted Royal Albert Hall it's a      
OL,20, potentially sad time.

OL,6,GThe evening was well presented, hopeful

OL,8, 'normal' awards show - and look forward
OL,9, to that happening once more.

OL,12,Greality show, a familiar format - round
OL,13,Gup hopefuls with a particular skill,   
OL,14, set them weekly challenges, have a star
OL,15, performer each time, send one of them  
OL,16, home each time - all after a judging   
OL,17,Gpanel shower them in compliments and   
OL,18,Gfire darts of poison too. Find your

OL,6,GI wasn't going to watch this, on the   
OL,7,Gevening of transmission I even declared
OL,8, I would actively avoid it! So what     
OL,9,Ghappened? I watched it, I loved it!    
OL,10,G                                       
OL,11, A combination of Katherine Ryan's      
OL,12,Ghosting (very entertaining), judges    
OL,13, unknown to me but who are growing on   
OL,14, me... and a really fascinating skillset
OL,15, involved in creating these jewellery   
OL,16, pieces - impressive stuff and bringing 
OL,17, us an aspect that is different. Can't  
OL,18, wait for next week!
