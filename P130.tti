OL,6, Kenneth was a complex man, as anyone   
OL,7, who has read his diaries and delved    
OL,8, further will understand.               
OL,10, As with many comedy greats, this was a 
OL,11, life that had a tragic edge.           
OL,13, A classical actor, with aspirations far
OL,14,Ghigher than the Carry On films - yet he
OL,15, begrudgingly loved them and knew what  
OL,16, people loved him for the most.         
OL,18, I have seen these clips countless times
OL,19, before, but still fall about every     
OL,20, time, such was his power to amuse.

OL,6, A chat show appearance meant the host

OL,9, possible way.
