OL,6,GThis week saw another documentary      
OL,7,Gseries about the 45th US President     
OL,8, continue.                              
OL,10, I've already viewed one similar series 
OL,11, - and I feel that we're likely to see  
OL,12, his time in the White House documented 
OL,13, on other occasions yet to come. After  
OL,14, all, there's so much material!         
OL,15,G                                       
OL,16,CTrump Takes On The WorldGis gripping,  
OL,17,Gdocumenting week by week aspects of his
OL,18, presidency. Talking heads throughout - 
OL,19, many of them people who knew him very  
OL,20, well and also those who worked for him.

OL,6,GNow that the orange one has departed   
OL,7,Gfor sunny Florida, it's already seeming
OL,8, surreal - a 'did that happen?' vibe! It
OL,9, seems bonkers now that this man was    
OL,10, ever given the opportunity to be the   
OL,11, most powerful in the world.            
OL,13,GLike most accidents, you don't want to 
OL,14, watch, but it's very hard to look away 
OL,15, too!

OL,6, Netflix, for all of it's blockbuster   
OL,7, hits and wide appeal juggernaut shows, 
OL,8, does have this kind of 'hidden' gem in

OL,13, closer look and who knows what you may
