OL,6, Not only does Nigella present a very   
OL,7, sophisticated image and programme, she 
OL,8, looks incredible, has great            
OL,9, intelligence and humour - oh yeah - and
OL,10, creates delicious meals!               
OL,12, An aspect that has always stood out to 
OL,13, me is that she is a comedy genius!     
OL,14,G                                       
OL,15, I think she knows this all too well, as
OL,16, most of us are aware these shows are   
OL,17, littered with innuendo. There are      
OL,18, fantastic one liners and flourishes of 
OL,19, such ridiculousness that Nigella and   
OL,20, the team must be completely in on these
OL,21, japes! Filth!

OL,6, I thoroughly enjoyed the return, almost
OL,7, as though not a day has elapsed since  
OL,8, her last appearance... even revelling  
OL,9, in the bizarre destruction of perfectly
OL,10, good fish fingers to create a new dish!
OL,12,CSaving Britain's Pubs with Tom Kerridge
OL,13, was one I was looking forward to for   
OL,14, other reasons. I quite like him, not   
OL,15,Galways as much as I think I will... but
OL,16,GI certainly enjoy this kind of show,

OL,6, Tom visits various pubs around the     
OL,7, country, all of them in difficulty and 
OL,8,Gneeding a guiding hand - and that was  
OL,9, before the new challenges that Covid   
OL,10, brought to such small independent      
OL,11, businesses.                            
OL,13,GI was particularly drawn to Lana, the  
OL,14,Glikeable landlady of a London tavern,  
OL,15,Gwhose plight was clear - but she was   
OL,16,Gsomeone you really believed in.        
OL,18,GI wanted to drink in her pub so badly  
OL,19, by the close, a few jars to help boost 
OL,20, her coffers.

OL,10, Ella was a genius, a towering talent   
OL,11, who rightly deserves this kind of      
OL,12,Gtribute. Her voice was incredible and  
OL,13, the talking heads testify that she was

OL,19, something that made the account        
OL,20, poignant and all the more impressive   
OL,21, when talking about talent.
