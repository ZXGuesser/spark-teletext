OL,6, I'm a bit of a Royalist, but even I can
OL,7, be put off by aGPrincess Diana         
OL,8, documentary every night of the week. We
OL,9, know her inside out by now, yet still  
OL,10, her image is rarely away from the      
OL,11, screen.                                
OL,13, The 'Dianafication' of the UK did seem 
OL,14, to change everything, I suspect, in    
OL,15, that we are more excruciatingly over   
OL,16, emotional about people we never knew,  
OL,17, when we cannot shed a tear over what is
OL,18, more profound or close to home.

OL,6, When I say 'we', I mean those we may   
OL,7, see on telly (partly)! Shows like The X
OL,8, Factor, Britain's Got Talent... but not
OL,9, just those, right through to The Repair
OL,10, Shop and DIY SOS - nothing counts now, 
OL,11, unless you're blubbing your eyes out.  
OL,13,GYet, in spite of all that, Diana was   
OL,14,Ghypnotic and she remains so. I still   
OL,15, watchedCDiana: Her Last SummerGwith    
OL,16, fascination. They tried to put a       
OL,17, different spin on it of course, but I  
OL,18,Gknew every detail of this... I guess   
OL,19, she's never had an escape, not even    
OL,20, now.

OL,6, The Street was built on those          
OL,7, battleaxes - Ena Sharples, Blanche     
OL,8, Hunt, Elsie Tanner, and many more. Some
OL,9, classic scenes were shown, barnstorming
OL,10, rows, fishwife blazing arguments in    
OL,11, public - washing their dirty linen with
OL,12, abandon!                               
OL,14, In its prime - and I get the creeping  
OL,15, feeling that time has passed - Corrie  
OL,16, did this like nobody else.             
OL,18, It's still impressive to see some of   
OL,19, those historic set pieces.

OL,6,CThe One ShowGis something, probably    
OL,7, like you, that I dip in and out of. I  
OL,8, don't necessarily want to watch it     
OL,9, every night, nor do I have the time to.
OL,11, After catching an episode this week    
OL,12, though, I do think it has really come  
OL,13, into its own during lockdown and       
OL,14, beyond.                                
OL,16, Television has lynchpin programmes and 
OL,17, The One Show has become the new        
OL,18, Nationwide - only much more than that  
OL,19, in some ways.

OL,6, Recently, we have the socially         
OL,7, distanced guests, the multiple video   
OL,8, calls with celebs, the guest hosts     
OL,9, (this week comedian Chris Ramsey).     
OL,11, Plus, of course, the ditsy and loveable
OL,12, Alex Jones. She shouldn't be successful
OL,13, really, should she?! Yet, she is       
OL,14, totally endearing. Drink it in!        
OL,16, Her moment of mimicking Derren Brown's 
OL,17, mindreading, with Nicola Roberts from  
OL,18, Girls Aloud, was hilarious and         
OL,19, cringeworthy all at once - and you'd   
OL,20, never get this anywhere else! Another  
OL,21, reason to love it!
