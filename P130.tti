OL,6, This week's telly: Piers Morgan's Life 
OL,7, Stories: Dame Joan Collins - ITV; Diana
OL,8, - ITV; The Hotel Inspector - Channel 5 
OL,10, This week's reviews feel like revisits 
OL,11, - not repeats, but places I've taken   
OL,12, you to before, and am happy to again!  
OL,14, The first of which is Piers Morgan's   
OL,15, Life Stories - he's a pal of Dame Joan 
OL,16, Collins, so not surprising that he     
OL,17, would secure another interview with    
OL,18, her, to celebrate seventy years in     
OL,19, showbusiness (her, not him).

OL,6, I feel we need to celebrate this great 
OL,7, woman personally, how incredible she is
OL,8, at eighty eight years old! I recall    
OL,9, seeing her in the Theatre Royal Norwich
OL,10, a couple of years ago - even with the  
OL,11, wigs and the make up and the illusions 
OL,12, created, there is no denying - how many
OL,13, women of her age are looking like this 
OL,14, and doing this well?!                  
OL,16, As you can imagine, it's a frank and   
OL,17, honest exchange - as far as it ever can
OL,18, be on television. They enjoyed banter  
OL,19, and stories of her colourful life and  
OL,20, career.

OL,6, Some of it is far more colourful than  
OL,7, you would expect from the lips of an   
OL,8, eight eight year old too!              
OL,10, There were moments my cynicism kicked  
OL,11, in - a time of supposedly being moved, 
OL,12, but it seemed more like a performance, 
OL,13, as she heard accounts from dear        
OL,14, friends.                               
OL,16, That faded away though during the      
OL,17, discussions about her late sister      
OL,18, Jackie - a sensitive, moving matter -  
OL,19, and one which she handled with honesty 
OL,20, and emotion - and interwoven with      
OL,21, comments expected from a sister.

OL,6, These siblings were clearly very close 
OL,7, and you can feel the pain of the loss  
OL,8, very acutely.                          
OL,10, Dame Joan is a powerhouse of a woman,  
OL,11, someone I feel in awe of, always       
OL,12, welcome on the screen.                 
OL,14, Another iconic woman was also revisited
OL,15, this week by ITV. Diana was an hour and
OL,16, a half documentary, commemorating what 
OL,17, would have been Princess Diana's       
OL,18, sixtieth birthday!                     
OL,20, That in itself is quite something -    
OL,21, twenty four years since she died!

OL,6, The passage of time has been rapid and 
OL,7, I almost didn't watch this. I was      
OL,8, thinking how can this show me anything 
OL,9, new, it's covering old ground etc.     
OL,11, I was right in the main - but I was    
OL,12, still glad I checked it out. There were
OL,13, moments of rare footage, mainly        
OL,14, highlighting Diana mingling with       
OL,15, ordinary people, in a way that the     
OL,16, Royals never had before. She had her   
OL,17, flaws, but she did make a positive     
OL,18, impact in many ways and leaves a       
OL,19, legacy.

OL,6, The Hotel Inspector is a welcome return
OL,7, - I just had to make mention of this   
OL,8, week's episode. Alex Polizzi is a joy  
OL,9, to have on our Covid weary screens!    
OL,11, Of course, the subject of Covid is     
OL,12, prominent in this series, showing the  
OL,13, impact on the hospitality sector and   
OL,14, providing Alex with a further challenge
OL,15, - to put it mildly!                    
OL,17, This week, she tackles a pub (it is    
OL,18, becoming much more The Pub Inspector, I
OL,19, noticed) run by a popular young man -  
OL,20, but he is struggling to make ends meet,
OL,21, doesn't know what his focus is.

OL,6, Some of the usual show bingo is here - 
OL,7, too much on the menu, check; clutter in
OL,8, the bar, check; tired decor and mucky  
OL,9, bathroom, check!                       
OL,11, What really made for a lively episode  
OL,12, this time though - his mother! She was 
OL,13, 'helping' out and wow, they really knew
OL,14, how to push each others' buttons! The  
OL,15, woman was a monster and even Alex      
OL,16, looked like she was shocked at the     
OL,17, outbursts!                             
OL,19, Well worth catching up on a lively one 
OL,20, and who knows, if other episodes match 
OL,21, this I may review again!
