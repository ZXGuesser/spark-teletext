OL,11, recommend getting up to speed pretty   
OL,12, quickly! It's likely to have been      
OL,13, hanging around your list, peeking at   
OL,14, you, trying to lure you in!            
OL,16, Which is a similar feeling when you    
OL,17, start viewing too, it gets under your  
OL,18, skin and, before you know it, you're   
OL,19, binging bleary eyed late at night and

OL,5, Each series is a different storyline,  
OL,6, with a largely changed cast of         
OL,7, characters. That is, aside from Bill   
OL,8, Pullman's Detective Ambrose.           
OL,10, I mentioned him last week, playing the 
OL,11, President in 'Independence Day', the   
OL,12, kind of role that you would expect for 
OL,13, him twenty years ago.                  
OL,15,CThe SinnerGmust have been changing his 
OL,16, agent's call list rapidly. This is a   
OL,17, role unlike any other - a mumbling,    
OL,18, sometimes almost incoherent, flawed to 
OL,19, the point of distraction man - who is  
OL,20, in many ways as troubled as the        
OL,21,Gsubjects of his investigations.

OL,5, Pullman is, as you've probably guessed,
OL,6, the heart of the drama. He is so good! 
OL,7, Yet it's not all about him. Each run   
OL,8, has brought with it a gripping scenario
OL,9, and a cast of characters who blow you  
OL,10, away with intensity. They hypnotise you
OL,11, with assured skills in conveying       
OL,12, descent into madness... or is it?      
OL,14, Is it just the struggle that they face 
OL,15, and the best any of us would do?       
OL,16, I don't want to say too much, because  
OL,17, you need to follow this trio of tales  
OL,18, yourself. It should be from the        
OL,19, beginning, or you won't know the impact
OL,20, each investigation has on Ambrose.

OL,5,GMatt Bomer, whom I know from American  
OL,6, Horror Story in the main, is a         
OL,7, revelation in the current run. He's    
OL,8, charismatic, hypnotic, psychotic,      
OL,9, frightening, warm and cold...and, as

OL,5, If you don't, it really doesn't make a 
OL,6, difference. Lady Bunny was a founder of
OL,7, the Wigstock drag festival in New York 
OL,8, city in the 80s and 90s and this HBO   
OL,9, made doc film is both history and      
OL,10, revival.                               
OL,12, We learn how this event was founded,   
OL,13, fizzled and was then brought back a    
OL,14, couple of years ago.                   
OL,16, Now, you know with HBO that you're     
OL,17, going to get a quality production..and 
OL,18, this is no exception. By the time you  
OL,19, get to the near years, these are       
OL,20, personas and people whom you feel      
OL,21, you've really got to know.

OL,5, I want to be friends with Bunny quite  
OL,6, badly now. You feel the worth of       
OL,7, Wigstock, beneath the glitter and      
OL,8, shimmer and hilarity and... wigs... it 
OL,9, really made a difference and helped    
OL,10, glue together a community.             
OL,12, Ru and Bunny have made it easier for   
OL,13, the up and comers with shows like Drag 
OL,14, Race...but who made it easier for      
OL,15, them?!                                 
OL,17, So, finally, we move to an altogether  
OL,18, different kind of performance.

OL,5, Less so mainly because Bob shoved him  
OL,6, out of the way and took the limelight! 
OL,7, This is something Midge's ex Annabel   
OL,8, Giles remained very vocal about here,  
OL,9, something juicy like this is always    
OL,10, documentary gold!                      
OL,12, Midge, bless him, maintained that Bob  
OL,13, didn't mean it that way...or is he just
OL,14, too nice to say it?!                   
OL,16, This was just one of many fascinating  
OL,17, behind the scenes stories here,        
OL,18, including eye popping details around   
OL,19, the American side of things.
