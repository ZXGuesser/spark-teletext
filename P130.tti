OL,6, This week's telly:CCoronation Street   
OL,7,C60th AnniversaryBITV/ITV3              
OL,9, A special week on television and here  
OL,10, on SPARKY too. Sixty years ago this    
OL,11, week, the world's longest running      
OL,12, television soap opera began life on ITV
OL,13, - the first kitchen sink, working class
OL,14,Gdrama seen on UK television.           
OL,15,G                                       
OL,16, It wasn't long before the young Tony   
OL,17,GWarren's brainchild was a smash hit!   
OL,18,GThe Street, Corrie, is something that  
OL,19,Gis most people's cultural radar in one 
OL,20, way or another. Even if it's just 'that
OL,21, crap Mum and Dad watch', the serial is 
OL,22, embedded within the national psyche.

OL,6, People underestimate the power of the  
OL,7, show.                                  
OL,9, From the Granada Studios powerhouse,   
OL,10, back in the days when ITV had regional 
OL,11, identities with real meaning to the    
OL,12, community, it changed the landscape of 
OL,13, the television that followed. Without  
OL,14,Git, what we watch now would have been  
OL,15, so different.                          
OL,17, This week's televisual celebrations    
OL,18, were a treat indeed. Not only did we   
OL,19, have the climax of a long running      
OL,20, storyline in the anniversary episode,  
OL,21, but a couple of great documentaries.

OL,6, First up was the obligatory history of 
OL,7, the soap, talking heads and clips I    
OL,8, have certainly seen before, but        
OL,9, repackaged in a fresh way. There was   
OL,10, also a second about the strong women of
OL,11,Gthe street.                            
OL,12,C                                       
OL,13, The importance of these characters must
OL,14, not be underestimated. Imagine in 1960,
OL,15,Ghow well represented would strong and  
OL,16,Gopinionated women have been on         
OL,17, television? Exactly.                   
OL,19,GPersonalities like Ena Sharples, Elsie 
OL,20, Tanner and Annie Walker paved the way  
OL,21, and laid cobbles for many other female 
OL,22,Gfeet that followed.

OL,6, Added into the mix were repeats of     
OL,7, classic episodes, which I enjoy daily  
OL,8,Gon ITV3 anyway. These are currently at 
OL,9, the 1997 mark and were enhanced this   
OL,10, week at 10pm every night with further  
OL,11, nostalgic visits.                      
OL,13,GAmongst these, the first ever episode  
OL,14,G(groundbreaking!), one from 1970 (black
OL,15,Gand white but crystal clear, oh look   
OL,16,Gthere's Anne Reid!),two from 1980, 1990
OL,17, (Mike and Jackie!) and 2000 (Audrey    
OL,18,Gmeets Prince Charles) and 2010 (the    
OL,19, tram crash).                           
OL,21, I'd not seen the 1980 selections, which
OL,22, were fascinating.

OL,6,GThey focused on Emily Swain - not      
OL,7,GBishop - and her discovery that second 
OL,8, husband Arnold was a bigamist.         
OL,10, Great performances followed in a Street
OL,11, that seemed bleaker and grittier than  
OL,12,Gwhat I'd seen before from that era,    
OL,13, quite an eye opener.                   
OL,15, Overall, it was a milestone week that  
OL,16,Gcemented my love of this soap. The only
OL,17, one that impresses me as much is The   
OL,18, Archers, almost due for their 70th     
OL,19,Ganniversary on BBC Radio 4!            
OL,21, What broadcasting quality. Or is it?

OL,6,GThat's the part that worries me. After 
OL,7, all of this revelling in the glorious  
OL,8, history, I am left with an easy feeling
OL,9,Gthat the best days are gone.           
OL,11, The Corrie of today is not quite the   
OL,12,Gsame, some of that natural humour has  
OL,13,Gdiluted, too much sensationalism       
OL,14, seeping in. Yet I hope for the best.
