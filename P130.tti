OL,6, I've always loved Louis' style - laid  
OL,7, back, a curious bystander and with this
OL,8, calm technique that helps to draw out  
OL,9, answers and also show the subjects     
OL,10, exactly for who they are.              
OL,12, When faced with a lunatic, with views  
OL,13, that beggar belief, he has a method of 
OL,14,Gquestioning up to a point - but then   
OL,15, knowing when to halt, to stand in      
OL,16, silence and just look as they say their
OL,17, piece.

OL,6, This was very much in evidence during  
OL,7, his interview with an extreme right    
OL,8, wing family. He speculated about their 
OL,9, views on Jews - 'what if I were a Jew?'
OL,10, - and the atmosphere quickly changed.  
OL,12, Empathy is immediate, you were actually
OL,13, fearing for his safety, as he continued
OL,14, to question their way of thinking - why
OL,15, did it matter to them if someone was   
OL,16, Jewish?                                
OL,18, Years later, it's so powerful, no      
OL,19,Gwonder he's still on our screens now.

OL,6, Her journey was fascinating, with some 
OL,7, heart-wrenching stories told about     
OL,8, those living at the lower end of the   
OL,9, luck scale, a mother whose son was shot
OL,10, dead by border guards... through to the

OL,14, Yet through it all, there seems to be  
OL,15, one person who was most important to   
OL,16, Sue - and that was Sue! Interrupting,  
OL,17, often stealing the limelight and       
OL,18, directing the focus too quickly back   
OL,19, around. A shame.

OL,6,GThat's an exaggeration of course, but  
OL,7, when the programme gets to its         
OL,8, conclusion of totting up the savings   
OL,9, figures, it gets quite exciting!       
OL,11, Sure, we can do this without the help  
OL,12, of a telly show - with Gregg grinning  
OL,13, insanely and Chris up the apples and   
OL,14, pears - but seeing Joe Public being    
OL,15, told their taste buds can't tell the   
OL,16, difference and they can shop smarter is
OL,17, pretty entertaining!
