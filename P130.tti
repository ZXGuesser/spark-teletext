OL,11, Brian Cox has one of those voices,     
OL,12, doesn't he? A calm, soft, soothing tone
OL,13, that instantly sets you at ease.       
OL,15, Aside from that, he knows a thing or   
OL,16, two! Having enjoyed all previous       
OL,17, series, I was definitely up for        
OL,18, revisiting with this repackaged and    
OL,19, reimagined run about the cosmos.

OL,6, These episodes are a thing of beauty.  
OL,7, Of course, it helps that I have had a  
OL,8, lifelong fascination with the planets, 
OL,9, space and what extraterrestrial life   
OL,10, may be out there!                      
OL,12, The space shots, both real when        
OL,13, captured by the New Horizons and other 
OL,14, missions, and CGI created, are         
OL,15, mesmerising - taking us on a journey   
OL,16, with Cox's dreamy narrative.           
OL,18, Pure pleasure to end my Sunday into    
OL,19, bank holiday Monday - I was even       
OL,20, looking up the soundtrack online, to   
OL,21, keep the soundscape in easy reach!

OL,6, The Pact - this twice a week BBC1      
OL,7, thriller has been creating a buzz over 
OL,8, the last few weeks - and that's just   
OL,9, with my own family!                    
OL,11, They, and also a good friend, have been
OL,12, recommending this series to be         
OL,13, enthusiastically - together with the   
OL,14, telly interviews and reviews that keep 
OL,15, popping up also!                       
OL,17, Purely by chance, by the time I got    
OL,18, around to binge watching on iPlayer, it
OL,19, was approaching the final two episodes 
OL,20, on BBC1 anyway.

OL,6, Ploughing my way through several in one
OL,7, sitting, this drama is gripping,       
OL,8, clever, filled with fine actors        
OL,9, creating characters you really begin   
OL,10, the care about.                        
OL,12, I love the way it built momentum and   
OL,13, kept us guessing right up the final    
OL,14, moments. With a conclusion both        
OL,15, satisfying and frustrating in equal    
OL,16, measure, it also had a magical         
OL,17, atmospheric quality.                   
OL,19, It's quite hard to put my finger on it,
OL,20, but the style and feel did put me in   
OL,21, mind of Scandi drama.

OL,6, Shows like 'The Killing' have left     
OL,7, their mark in many ways and seep into  
OL,8, our production hallmarks too.          
OL,10, Finally this week, I settled down to   
OL,11, watch Joey Essex: Grief and Me. This   
OL,12, one off documentary has been heavily   
OL,13, promoted and discussed. I have to      
OL,14, confess, The Only Way Is Essex is a    
OL,15, guilty pleasure of mine, not something 
OL,16, I watch now but I did catch it in      
OL,17, Joey's day.                            
OL,19, He's always been that happy go lucky,  
OL,20, cheeky chappy type. Endearing qualities
OL,21, of childlike innocence and naivety -

OL,6, not necessarily making him look stupid,
OL,7, but creating the laugh with, not at,   
OL,8, scenario.                              
OL,10, That childlike quality was highlighted 
OL,11, here as part of an altogether more     
OL,12, serious situation. Joey's mother took  
OL,13, her own life when he was ten years old 
OL,14, and we followed him beginning therapy  
OL,15, for the first time.                    
OL,17, Trying to move forward, to step beyond 
OL,18, the little boy who was so hurt he      
OL,19, remained just that - a frightened boy, 
OL,20, who was determined to never be hurt    
OL,21, again, so lived life on the run.

OL,6, He's spent ten years living life in the
OL,7, fast lane, to avoid feeling and        
OL,8, grieving and letting himself move      
OL,9, forward.                               
OL,11, It was emotional of course, leaving me 
OL,12, with a new found respect for him and   
OL,13, highlighting how simple steps can lead 
OL,14, to enormous strides in progress.       
OL,16, The show was neatly wrapped up, perhaps
OL,17, a little too neatly - seemingly having 
OL,18, solved the predicament and all         
OL,19, displayed as right in his world.

OL,6, I think that was simply because, to fit
OL,7, the running time, we had to skip over  
OL,8, and skim a number of weeks and stages  
OL,9, in order to reach some sort of         
OL,10, conclusion.                            
OL,12, The reality is, he'll continue to work 
OL,13, on this and become a happier man for   
OL,14, it. This approaches a very sensitive   
OL,15, subject, no doubt helping many people  
OL,16, in the process.                        
OL,18, It was a brave step for Joey - and huge
OL,19, respect to him for having opened up in 
OL,20, such a raw and powerful way.
