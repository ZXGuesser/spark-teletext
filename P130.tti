OL,13, What did we all watch over the festive

OL,16, entertainment more than ever before.

OL,8, then ventured toCDunkirkB(BBC1)G-      
OL,9, wonderfully made film and unusually for

OL,11, won't mash your brain!

OL,6, New Year's Eve ticked on around and    
OL,7, what a different one this year, eh?    
OL,8, Instead of my usual dinner party with  
OL,9, friends (that ends with drunken        
OL,10, dancing), I had food delivered,a       
OL,11, virtual quiz, whisky in hand and the   
OL,12, box on!                                
OL,14,CGraham NortonB(BBC1)Gand his guests

OL,6, I am a little biased - Alicia Keys is a
OL,7, favourite artist and is the kind of    
OL,8, generous and warm hearted personality  
OL,9, to brighten up the cold eve.           
OL,11, Meanwhile, I know plenty of people who 
OL,12, cannot stand Jools - but I'm not too   
OL,13, fussed about him anyway, it's the      
OL,14, guests for me. Good ol' Tom Jones,     
OL,15, still belting them out at 80 (he's had 
OL,16, his vaccine, lovely) and Roisin Murphy 
OL,17, - whose new album is a lockdown love.  
OL,19, Here's to a 2021 that is safe, healthy,
OL,20, happy - and hopefully full of great    
OL,21, telly!
