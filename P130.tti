OL,11, Some would say this was a massive week 
OL,12, for television! I'd say probably one of
OL,13, the most divisive - it's all very

OL,6,GNo such worries with ITV, who were     
OL,7,Gsteaming ahead to snatch the rights to 
OL,8,COprah with Meghan & Harry.             
OL,10, I'll be honest, a big part of me didn't
OL,11, want to watch, but curiosity got the   
OL,12, better of me! Plus, I am Sparky, it    
OL,13, comes with the territory!              
OL,15,GI have always admired Oprah, she makes 
OL,16,Git look easy, I do think she has her   
OL,17,Gmedia empire for a reason - very       
OL,18, skilful at engaging with the subject   
OL,19, and drawing out their stories with     
OL,20, trust.

OL,6,GI'm almost scared to state a strong    
OL,7,Gopinion, for fear of pitchfork and     
OL,8, flaming torch reprisals! Also, this was
OL,9, so controversial and the repercussions 
OL,10, are far reaching.                      
OL,12,GI have no doubt that the Royals are    
OL,13,Gcold and aloof and that Meghan and     
OL,14, Harry have endured difficult times.    
OL,16, Yet, I found my gob dropping open in   
OL,17,Gdisbelief at specific moments - Meghan 
OL,18,Gnoting that she knew nothing of what   
OL,19, she was getting into, did no research  
OL,20, etc. Also, just putting it out there - 
OL,21, a moment of crying saw no tears, not   
OL,22, one... which reminds me of bad acting.

OL,7,Gcan I, but just saying what I see!     
OL,9,CThe Celebrity CircleGis something I've 
OL,10, been looking forward to! As you may    
OL,11, know, I was hooked on the USA civvy    
OL,12,Gversion and the previous two UK series.
OL,14, I love the concept - and it's so       
OL,15, appropriate for lockdown! Stick a bunch
OL,16, of people into their own apartments,   
OL,17, they don't see each other and only make
OL,18, contact via a social media platform -

OL,11, Her friend and co-star John Thomson    
OL,12, presented and it was the style you'd   
OL,13, expect, memories interwoven with clips.
OL,14,GIt was moving to see, looking back at  
OL,15,Gthis lady's sharp wit - not just a     
OL,16, great writer, but a talented performer 
OL,17, bringing those lines to life.
