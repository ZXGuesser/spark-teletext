OL,11, My opinion of Katie Price has certainly
OL,12, changed over years and never more so   
OL,13, than this week. I'd come around to the 
OL,14, idea of thinking she's actually a smart
OL,15, businesswoman, she knows what she's    
OL,16, doing!                                 
OL,17,G                                       
OL,18, Also, she's a bit of a comedy genius   
OL,19, and has a knack for amusing in many    
OL,20, ways, not just unintentionally! In     
OL,21, spite of a colourful private life, she 
OL,22, seems to maintain a happy home too.

OL,6,GWhich is where we arrive atCKatie      
OL,7,CPrice: Harvey & Me.GAfter watching     
OL,8, this, I have so much admiration for her
OL,9, as a mother. She is clearly a brilliant
OL,10, Mum and the way she copes is           
OL,11, incredible.                            
OL,13, The care and the bond shown was amazing
OL,14, - Harvey has such complex needs and it 
OL,15,Gwas genuinely worrying in the moments  
OL,16, when his mood changed, but of course   
OL,17,Gsuch a great parent knows how to       
OL,18, diffuse these situations as best they  
OL,19, can. In contrast, he is a loving son   
OL,20, and you can see why everyone adores him
OL,21, and he leaves an impression on everyone
OL,22, he meets.

OL,6,GThe focus was on Harvey turning 18 and 
OL,7,GKatie searching for a residential      
OL,8, college for him and the challenges that
OL,9, presents them with. This was mingled   
OL,10, with touching exchanges, including a   
OL,11, wonderful scene when he shared his love
OL,12, of trains with a friend at Waterloo    
OL,13,Gstation.                               
OL,15, It was poignant, moving, uplifting and 
OL,16, beautiful. As Harvey himself said 'oh  
OL,17, it's lovely, what a day!'              
OL,19, There may be a pandemic, but that      
OL,20, doesn't keep Mary Berry from our       
OL,21, screens, dear me no!

OL,7,Ginevitable 'starry' version of a recent
OL,8, show that I have loved. I'm not even   
OL,9, sure why I enjoyed it so much, it just

OL,11, presenter (love Claudia!) and judges,  
OL,12,Gwith a warm comforting feel.           
OL,14, The two shows this week were nicely    
OL,15, entertaining, with challenges risen to,
OL,16, victory and failure - and of course    
OL,17, some social distancing banter!         
OL,18, The mix of celebs was varied - Ed      
OL,19, Byrne, Shobna Gulati being fun and     
OL,20, friendly...

OL,6, A charismatic character, this was a    
OL,7, fascinating journey through his        
OL,8, history, shocking twists and turns that
OL,9, often felt like fiction.               
OL,11, As a viewer, you're left in no doubt   
OL,12, about whether John was friend or foe - 
OL,13, and how he touched and impacted so many
OL,14, lives in so many ways.                 
OL,16, Even when there were many lessons to be
OL,17, learned and it was of its time...      
OL,18, there's always another DeLorean around 
OL,19, the next corner in business!
