OL,11, I've had a bit of an educational week  
OL,12, this time around! A dose of healthy    
OL,13, cookery, followed by insight into      
OL,14, health service true stories, ending in 
OL,15, an account of Britain's most notorious 
OL,16, prison hospital.                       
OL,18,CCook Clever, Waste Less with Prue &

OL,6, I love Prue and now Rupy too - no      
OL,7, nonsense and yet warm with it, they    
OL,8, have a great on screen partnership.    
OL,10, The recipes and advice were common     
OL,11, sense, yet simple enough for most of us
OL,12, to tackle - even the housewife in      
OL,13, question, from their family of the     
OL,14, week.                                  
OL,16, It always amazes me how useless some of
OL,17, these householders are! They can barely
OL,18, seem to boil an egg! Yet Prue and Rupy 
OL,19, taught healthy recipes that were simple
OL,20, to prepare.

OL,7,CHospitalGis a documentary I've rarely  
OL,8, seen, but it blew me away this week,   
OL,9, and was incredibly moving.             
OL,11, Focusing on those families with        
OL,12, challenging pregnancies, the stories   
OL,13, were heart breaking and miracle making 
OL,14, in equal measure.                      
OL,16, I feel it's important to see those     
OL,17, stories and experience the raw emotion 
OL,18, that comes with it.

OL,6, One particular story - a baby girl who 
OL,7, had inexplicably died the week before  
OL,8, her due date - had me in bits. Yet, I  
OL,9, was in awe of everyone involved - the  
OL,10, parents themselves and their having to 
OL,11, go through labour, and the team at the 
OL,12, hospital - who were emotionally        
OL,13, impacted, yet through their            
OL,14, consideration of the family kept it    
OL,15, inside until they were alone and away  
OL,16, from them.                             
OL,18, If you ever needed further proof of the
OL,19, amazing teams within the NHS - look no 
OL,20, further.

OL,7,CSecurityGwas a feature length        
OL,8, documentary that I didn't even intend  
OL,9, watching.                              
OL,11, Yet I found myself drawn into it, a    
OL,12, fascinating history of Britain's most  
OL,13, notorious prison hospital - with the   
OL,14, look of a frightening, Victorian gothic
OL,15, asylum, red brick wings and high walls 
OL,16, and fences.                            
OL,18, The programme focused on specific      
OL,19, inmates, the most infamous in its      
OL,20, history.

OL,6, Names like Peter Sutcliffe, Charles    
OL,7, Bronson, and Ronnie Kray. Each section 
OL,8, peppered with accounts from both       
OL,9, Broadmoor staff and those who visited  
OL,10, these men.                             
OL,12, A particularly fascinating moment was  
OL,13, presenter Fred Dineage talking about   
OL,14, his visits to interview Ronnie Kray,   
OL,15, for an upcoming book. Ronnie's room was
OL,16, like an hotel room - complete with     
OL,17, floral designs on his bed clothes, neat
OL,18, bedside table with ornaments...

OL,6, Also, alternative tales of Ron noted   
OL,7, that he always maintain his suited and 
OL,8, booted attire - and protected female   
OL,9, visitors from the gaze of the likes of 
OL,10, Peter Sutcliffe, noting 'they're all   
OL,11, mad in here, you know!'                
OL,13, Plus Charles Bronson, I was reminded of
OL,14, his rooftop protests, ripping roof     
OL,15, tiles off over the course of several   
OL,16, days and displaying violence like no   
OL,17, other inmate.                          
OL,19, The long and colourful history of      
OL,20, Broadmoor holds countless stories I'm  
OL,21, sure!
