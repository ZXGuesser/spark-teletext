OL,12, Winslet - not so much in the day of    
OL,13, 'Titanic', although she was impressive 
OL,14,Gat such a young age! Since though, her

OL,19, just as likely to appear on our small  
OL,20, screens, the quality of drama now akin 
OL,21, to a film.

OL,8,Gdowntrodden Pennsylvanian detective    
OL,9, Mare Sheehan (until I realised that, I

OL,13,Grubbish shows about houses now - she   
OL,14, should have stayed put! Jama is        
OL,15, engaging though. The first episode does
OL,16, not disappoint - judges Val Garland and
OL,17,GDominic Skinner are a great team.      
OL,18,G                                       
OL,19, Let's just say, the right person is

OL,21,GI really want to be Val's friend and   
OL,22, for her to shout 'DING DONG' at me!

OL,7,Gscheduling ofCBent CoppersGis of course

OL,11, It started off well, but there's       
OL,12,Gsomething not quite right here. I'm not
OL,13, sure this documentary series knows what
OL,14, it is trying to be.                    
OL,16, Is it a cool and smooth 70s style tale,
OL,17, with a funky soundtrack? Or is it as   
OL,18, dull as ditchwater, a talking heads    
OL,19, parade?

OL,8, retro clips linked with interviewees
