OL,10,GThis week has encouraged me to follow a
OL,11, retro path, not sure why - perhaps it's
OL,12, the thought of life returning to more  
OL,13, normality and the possibility of       
OL,14, different days ahead? Looking back to  
OL,15,G'old days' and having a temporary      
OL,16,Gcocoon of bygone telly?                
OL,17,G                                       
OL,18, That's a bit deep, isn't it? Before I  
OL,19, focus on the past, let's look at       
OL,20, something new!

OL,6,CDrawers OffGis quite an addition to the
OL,7,GChannel 4 late afternoon/early evening 
OL,8, schedule! We've had cooking slots,     
OL,9, baking, watercolours of landscapes,    
OL,10, antiques, dinner parties, you name it! 
OL,12, Now... it's life drawing! Not something
OL,13, I expected to see! This brings out the 
OL,14, 'Carry On' in me, making me chuckle    
OL,15,Ginstantly.                             
OL,16,G                                       
OL,17,GHosted by Jenny Eclair, who for me was 
OL,18, the main draw (pardon the pun) and     
OL,19, someone I would change channel for any 
OL,20, day of the week! I've loved everything 
OL,21, she's done for years, from novels to   
OL,22, articles, to radio shows... to now.

OL,6,GThe recipe of reality telly is all here

OL,17,GIf you need an introduction - and      
OL,18,Gsurely you don't, that's shocking -    
OL,19, this classic 70s sitcom focusing on the

OL,14, the test of time, one that you will    
OL,15, never tire of. Hilarious scenes, thanks
OL,16, to top notch writing by Esmonde and    
OL,17, Larbey and performances by a stellar   
OL,18, cast. Richard Briers, Felicity Kendal,

OL,6, Margo is one of comedy's finest        
OL,7, creations, and Keith's comic timing and
OL,8, skill in portraying a snob with        
OL,9,Gvulnerability and a soft side deserves 
OL,10, every accolade. Why not revisit today? 
OL,12, I stumbled acrossCCharles and Di's     
OL,13,CWedding 1981Gon Britbox, as I browsed  
OL,14,Gtheir new additions. This is the kind  
OL,15,Gof thing I am loving about the         
OL,16, streaming service - random gems that   
OL,17,Gwill never be repeated.                
OL,18,G                                       
OL,19,GThis counters criticism of the service,
OL,20,Gfounded by the BBC and ITV. Many moan  
OL,21, that they pay their licence fee, so why
OL,22, would they pay for Britbox?

OL,6, This... and much more, it's worth      
OL,7, trialling and delving deeper.          
OL,9,GWith all this royal chat in the news   
OL,10, and The Crown etc., it was fascinating 
OL,11, to see this wedding footage from ITN. I
OL,12, was six at the time and can't really   
OL,13, recall much of it, so I was transfixed 
OL,14,Gby the Britain portrayed in 1981.      
OL,15,G                                       
OL,16, A different world, hosted by a team    
OL,17, that included Selina Scott (can't have 
OL,18,Gbeen long before she was poached by the
OL,19,GBeeb for Breakfast Time), it looks so  
OL,20,Gdated and old fashioned.
