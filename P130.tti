OL,8,CEastEndersGback in the 90s was intense 
OL,9, melodrama when the Mitchell brothers   
OL,10, were involved and this was certainly   
OL,11, one of its most enjoyable eras. They've
OL,12, tried many times to recapture it, but  
OL,13, it's very of its time.                 
OL,15, This period has made us reassess soaps

OL,6, they would be all the better for       
OL,7, reducing the number of episodes back   
OL,8,Gdown to twice a week. Less is more and

OL,17, and choose. Recommended to me by a

OL,20, be the next make up superstar!

OL,6, urge you to catch up on iplayer!       
OL,8, Each week sees a new challenge (you    
OL,9, know the drill!), displaying their     
OL,10, skills as an MUA (makeup artist) in a  
OL,11, variety of scenarios.                  
OL,13, This isn't simply showing who can apply
OL,14, the best blusher, or get the shade of  
OL,15, lipstick to co-ordinate with the outfit
OL,16, you know. Dear me no, these contestants
OL,17, have the chance to show off their full

OL,19, looks that really do blow your socks

OL,6, night saw showings of Independence Day 
OL,7, and the sequel - funnily enough,       
OL,8, because it was July 4th!

OL,11, (not so much the second one, they      
OL,12, should have left it), so had a little  
OL,13, dip in the Roland Emmerich directed

OL,15, infused fun!

OL,18, and suspense, to the adrenalin rush of 
OL,19, seeing aliens wreak havoc on Earth's
