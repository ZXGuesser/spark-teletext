OL,6, So for soap addicts, this is heavenly! 
OL,8, Both of these drama juggernauts are at 
OL,9, the mid-90s episodes right now, some   
OL,10, would argue a heyday for both ongoing  
OL,11, dramas.                                
OL,13, Corrie culminates this week in Deirdre 
OL,14,Gand Ken almost getting back to living  
OL,15, together again, only for she of the    
OL,16, huge glasses to get cold feet and then,
OL,17, after a big row, Ken goes and sleeps   
OL,18, with his boss!                         
OL,20, Also, Roy is about to buy Alma's share 
OL,21, of the cafe, thus beginning his story  
OL,22, of culinary prowess!

OL,14, likes of A Nightmare on Elm Street,    
OL,15, Halloween, Friday the 13th - those 80s 
OL,16, slasher flicks! Also, some gross out   
OL,17, moments from The Howling, American     
OL,18, Werewolf in London, body transformation

OL,16,GParliament is worth keeping an eye on, 
OL,17, because every once in a while they

OL,19, this case, 1974, a time of such        
OL,20, upheaval in the UK.

OL,6,GIt had acres of coverage, so I recorded

OL,8, highlights. Opening with 'Fanfare of   
OL,9, the Common Man' and presented by       
OL,10, Alastair Burnett (BBC days before his  
OL,11, long term move to ITN).                
OL,13, Grey in look and tone... but when you  
OL,14, look at the political landscape now,   
OL,15, even in such complicated times it      
OL,16,Gseemed a simpler period than now -     
OL,17, hindsight smooths out those rough edges
OL,18, and encourages amnesia!
