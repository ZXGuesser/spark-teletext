OL,10, So now that the lovely Yorkshire Farm  
OL,11, show has finished, Channel 5 have made 
OL,12, a smart move and looked to hold onto   
OL,13, that audience, by bringing backCAll    
OL,14,CCreatures Great & Small.               
OL,16, I have to admit, I was wary about      
OL,17, watching this! I have very fond        
OL,18, memories of the original, a Sunday     
OL,19,Gfavourite - along with all those others
OL,20, - that I would enjoy with the family   
OL,21, before heading back to school.

OL,6, I loved the booming Robert Hardy as    
OL,7, Siegfried, Peter Davidson as Tristan,  
OL,8, lovely Lynda Bellingham as Helen (the  
OL,9, second, I know!)... and if I am honest,
OL,10, always found Christopher Timothy a     
OL,11, little odd as James.                   
OL,13, Although that makes more sense now, the
OL,14,Gawkwardness of the character, trying to
OL,15, fit into the close-knit community.     
OL,17, I was pleasantly surprised, this new   
OL,18, version is a joy! Great actors, doing  
OL,19, the characters justice, beautiful      
OL,20, scenery!

OL,6, Nicholas Ralph was perfectly cast as   
OL,7, Herriot and I enjoyed Samuel West's    
OL,8, grumpy Farnon too, along with some of  
OL,9, the heartwarming storylines that you'd 
OL,10, expect. Lovely stuff!                  
OL,12, Programmes like this serve a great     
OL,13, purpose, character development, quality
OL,14, production, morals to the story - we   
OL,15, need it more than ever. Personally, I  
OL,16, visited those places too, on many      
OL,17, family holidays - so the reminiscing   
OL,18, opportunities are continuous. Can't    
OL,19,Gwait for more!

OL,6, I always like to keep an eye on their  
OL,7, Friday night music show schedule, there
OL,8, are often gems - hidden or otherwise!  
OL,9, This jewel had been on display in the  
OL,10, shop window though and received some   
OL,11, publicity ahead of launch.             
OL,13,GSoul music has always been a favourite 
OL,14,Ggenre, throughout my life, so I was    
OL,15, sure to tune into this!                
OL,17, This first episode 'Amazing Grace'     
OL,18,Gfollowed journeys from the church      
OL,19, gospel traditions, through to the civil
OL,20, rights reforms in the USA and soul as  
OL,21, an expression of freedom.

OL,6, From these beginnings, came the first  
OL,7, stars of soul - Candi Staton, Aretha   
OL,8, Franklin, Sam Cooke, Mavis Staples (who
OL,9, I saw live at Latitude - she was       
OL,10, incredible!) - and the road to this    
OL,11, stardom for some was Motown.           
OL,12,G                                       
OL,13,GThe glossy sheen of Motown helped      
OL,14, create the sophisticated image that    
OL,15, propelled soul and its artists into the
OL,16, mainstream.                            
OL,18, As Mavis said 'you can sing a gospel   
OL,19, song, just change the word God to baby 
OL,20, and it's R 'n' B!'

OL,6, I could talk about this feast of a     
OL,7,Gdocumentary for a long time, I devoured
OL,8, it, such a rich history and clips of   
OL,9, tracks that line the route laid by such
OL,10, incredible talents.                    
OL,12, There's more to come, so maybe I will  
OL,13, come back to this!

OL,16,CTalent,Gone of those shows I rarely see
OL,17, and this year is no exception, even now
OL,18, it has returned to screens I just dip

OL,6,GYes, sometimes I have found something  
OL,7, very entertaining, enjoyable 'talent'  
OL,8, there - a guilty pleasure in a way.    
OL,9, Not for long though! I more likely find
OL,10, myself bemused by how popular this is, 
OL,11, wondering why the audience holler and  
OL,12, whoop and why people watching at home  
OL,13, feel it's so... important?             
OL,15, Instead, I am on the outside - Ant and 
OL,16, Dec seem like nice guys, but they're   
OL,17, not that good are they?! Amanda Holden 
OL,18, horrifies me with her outfits and      
OL,19, well...the main thought is - where is  
OL,20, this talent they speak of?!
