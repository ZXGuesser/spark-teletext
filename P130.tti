OL,6, The series quickly pulls you in with   
OL,7,Git's fun and frothy hedonism, yet we   
OL,8, all know that this is going to give way
OL,9, to something more serious and gruelling
OL,10, in the weeks to come.                  
OL,12,GYouTube is pretty much classified as a 
OL,13, streaming channel now isn't it, used   
OL,14, more and more in the same way as       
OL,15, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.        
OL,17, The difference being the choice is     
OL,18, never ending and includes public videos
OL,19, as well as complete TV series now.

OL,6, It's a retro telly goldmine! I've been

OL,8, sorts, which has now led to discovering

OL,11, If you don't recall, it was a 90s      
OL,12, Channel 4 interview show - celebrities 
OL,13, asked questions by a 'computer' i.e.   
OL,14,GKara Noble and her sultry voice.       
OL,16, I watched an episode with Julian Clary,
OL,17, one I still remember well. It was      
OL,18,Gfantastic, his deadpan delivery and    
OL,19,Ginnuendo peppered throughout the Q&A.

OL,6, Browsing through, there are about      
OL,7, twenty episodes to enjoy, from Peter   
OL,8, Gabriel to Bros... can't wait to check 
OL,9, out more!                              
OL,11, It also suits the retro feel noted     
OL,12, earlier in my review. If you were      
OL,13, watching Channel 4 in the 80s and 90s, 
OL,14, programmes like this are worth reliving
OL,15, and they transport you back to those   
OL,16, days in a heartbeat.
