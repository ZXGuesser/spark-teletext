OL,7,Gpopular in the States right now, with  
OL,8, her own NBC show, so it's good times   
OL,9, for the former Norfolk resident.       
OL,11, To say her life has been eventful would
OL,12,Gbe an understatement - a husband who   
OL,13, didn't tell her he had AIDS,           
OL,14, discovering the man she thought was her
OL,15, Dad was actually not, horrendous       
OL,16, racism... there was a lot to take in   
OL,17, and she is clearly a strong woman, with
