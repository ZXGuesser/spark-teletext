OL,6,CMax Richter's SleepGwas a wonderful    
OL,7, documentary about the composer's 9 hour
OL,8, opus, a truly magical musical journey  
OL,9, that saw concerts around the world as  
OL,10, an immersive experience.               
OL,12, I'd heard about this before and heard a
OL,13, fair chunk of it on BBC Radio 3 and    
OL,14, with a friend too a while ago. As soon 
OL,15,Gas it began, I was captivated.         
OL,17, It made me hanker after the days of gig
OL,18, going, and this being something so     
OL,19, different.

OL,6, Audiences around the globe, at venues  
OL,7,Glike Sydney Opera House, parks,        
OL,8, churches, the Barbican and more, saw a 
OL,9, stretch of beds lined up, row upon row 
OL,10, - ready to lie down and listen, doze,  
OL,11, sleep, dance, stand, sit, do anything  
OL,12, they wished during those hours. An

OL,16, I immediately wanted to attend and     
OL,17, hopefully one day I will. We were also 
OL,18, treated to a glimpse into the lives of 
OL,19, Max and his partner Yuliya too, their  
OL,20, partnership such a devoted and         
OL,21, inspiring one. This is the telly I pay

OL,8, intelligent and oh so righteous! That's
OL,9, obviously part of the appeal.

OL,6, The makers are no doubt hopeful that   
OL,7, the good habits shown will rub off on  
OL,8, viewers in the face of Covid and our   
OL,9, increasingly unhealthy lifestyles.     
OL,11, It was indeed really fascinating in    
OL,12, many areas, partly telling what I      
OL,13, already knew but also with enlightening
OL,14, advice.                                
OL,16, I particularly enjoyed the 'fight or   
OL,17, flight' discussion, highlighting that  
OL,18, short term stress is actually good for 
OL,19, boosting our immunity - it's the longer
OL,20, periods of it that we need to be       
OL,21, worried about!
