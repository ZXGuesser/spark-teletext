OL,6, A rather Machiavellian tale of the     
OL,7, media mogul Logan Roy (Brian Cox) and  
OL,8, his dysfunctional family and the power 
OL,9, struggles between his siblings to      
OL,10, secure the top slot, when Daddy dearest
OL,11, retires.                               
OL,13, Clearly taking some influence from     
OL,14,GRupert Murdoch's empire and dynasty,   
OL,15, this time around I am revelling in     
OL,16, every line and every nuanced           
OL,17, performance.                           
OL,19, I've always loved Brian Cox, but he    
OL,20, excels more than ever here - a         
OL,21, powerhouse of a man, unpredictable, hot
OL,22, tempered and not to be messed with.

OL,6, You start out thinking that no         
OL,7, character has any redeeming quality,   
OL,8, vile people!                           
OL,10, However, by the time you've got a few  
OL,11, episodes under your belt, you          
OL,12,Grealise... they are still vile, but on 
OL,13, a sliding scale, with chinks of        
OL,14, humanity visible. Watch it now!        
OL,16,CThe Trump ShowGfocuses on another mogul
OL,17, in the States, another dysfunctional   
OL,18, family, a whole melodrama in itself.

OL,6, From Donald Trump winning the US       
OL,7, presidential election and the journey  
OL,8,Gof the subsequent term we have all     
OL,9, witnessed from our own standpoint.     
OL,10, What lent an edge to this was the fact 
OL,11, that so many advisors and staff took   
OL,12, part, those who resigned or quit their 
OL,13,Gposts under Trump - some of them after 
OL,14,Gonly a few days.                       
OL,16,GTheir testimony in these trials of     
OL,17, sorts was gripping - tales of Trump    
OL,18,Gdeclaring war on the media and then    
OL,19, wondering why they turned on him in    
OL,20, return; stories of White House staff   
OL,21, getting short shrift when they tried to
OL,22, change his sheets.

OL,6,GWhich may seem trivial, but it paints a
OL,7, picture of a man who came to realise   
OL,8, that, rather than be overwhelmed by the
OL,9,Goffice, he would begin to do as he     
OL,10, pleased - be afraid, be very afraid!

OL,14, always intended to, so I must crack on 
OL,15, with that!                             
OL,17, I eagerly tuned in, always up for some 
OL,18, new sci fi, some dystopian future fun!

OL,20, to be for me.

OL,6,GA promising start, the glossy sheen of 
OL,7,G'New London' and it's beautiful        
OL,8, inhabitants, a cool soundtrack, the    
OL,9, design and feel is amazing so far.     
OL,11, It's leaving me cold though, coming    
OL,12, away from the viewing with a feeling of
OL,13, dissatisfaction and left wanting.      
OL,15, Maybe that's the idea though?          
OL,16,G                                       
OL,17, Perhaps I am not embracing the fact    
OL,18, that some sci-fi is intended to lack   
OL,19, emotional heart - something that may be
OL,20, missing from the characters' future?
