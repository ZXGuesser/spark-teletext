OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA```````G2/6A`
OL,6, David Walliams featured this time      
OL,7, around - someone who I used to be a big
OL,8, fan of, but time has faded my fandom - 
OL,9, I mean, he is on Britain's Got Talent  
OL,10, now, surely that's criminal?!          
OL,12, I still like the guy though and the    
OL,13, gentler side of his humour came across 
OL,14,Gduring this episode - and what an      
OL,15, ancestry it was!                       
OL,17, Such a poignant tale about a great     
OL,18, grandfather whose wartime shell shock  
OL,19, led to forty years in an asylum. We    
OL,20, were left with an image of a life not  
OL,21, totally unhappy though, one that ended 
OL,22, serenely.

OL,6, It was very moving - and then we heard 
OL,7, about the other side of the family and 
OL,8, a blind great grandfather who was not  
OL,9, held back by his disability - it was   
OL,10, the making of him. What a family! This 
OL,11, series makes me want to get down that  
OL,12,Grecords office - socially distanced, in
OL,13, face mask and gloves of course!        
OL,15,CBBC BreakfastG- my favourite way to    
OL,16,Gstart the day and I do miss it if I    
OL,17, skip an edition.                       
OL,19,GI particularly enjoy the end of the    
OL,20, week, when Charlie and Naga are the    
OL,21, helm! Did you know that he is 57?! A   
OL,22,Grecent revelation!

OL,6, The affection and sibling-like ribbing 
OL,7, is clear - and Naga's forthright       
OL,8,Gattitude can make viewing highly       
OL,9, entertaining. One moment she's grilling
OL,10, a politician, the next moment teasing  
OL,11, lovely Carol Kirkwood before the       
OL,12, weather, or giggling at an innuendo!   
OL,13,G                                       
OL,14,GThis is chemistry that you cannot buy -
OL,15, and certainly isn't present on         
OL,16,Gpoisonous Piers' Good Morning Britain! 
OL,17, Personally, I want to be informed and  
OL,18,Gentertained together, it's enhanced    
OL,19, when this family feel and lighthearted 
OL,20, touch cuts through and is the heart of 
OL,21, the show.

OL,6,CBlue Note Records: Beyond The NotesGwas
OL,7, a treat (after a brilliant Count Basie 
OL,8, doc) in the Friday night music slot    
OL,9,Gthat has become a staple for BBC4. Like
OL,10, the genre it was discussing, the style 
OL,11, was lounge, relaxed, decidedly cool.

OL,14, interludes, including excerpts from    
OL,15, studio time with some of jazz music's  
OL,16, geniuses. We need channels like BBC4   
OL,17, and slots like this because, like its  
OL,18, guests, this was permitted enough time 
OL,19, to explore the subject matter in detail
OL,20, - not rushing through and leaving the  
OL,21, fan with an unfulfilled empty space.
