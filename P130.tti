OL,12, even though I confess I haven't seen   
OL,13, all three instalments yet, one that

OL,6, A kindly small town doctor, in the old 
OL,7, fashioned sense.                       
OL,9, Doctor Shipman had a reputation that   
OL,10, was untarnished - the personal touch,  
OL,11, he would drop in on his patients       
OL,12, regularly, just to see if they were    
OL,13, okay.                                  
OL,14,G                                       
OL,15, Now, who wouldn't want that? These     
OL,16, days, we all complain about a lack of  
OL,17, home visits, difficulty in getting an  
OL,18, appointment, no one to one care at all.
OL,20, Doctor Shipman was adored by his       
OL,21, casebook folk, especially those little 
OL,22, old ladies who lived alone.

OL,6, Even when the investigations were      
OL,7, underway, he defended himself openly,  
OL,8, his patients defended him, the whole   
OL,9, community defended him.                
OL,11, That's what makes this tale a truly    
OL,12, terrifying one. The fact that a man    
OL,13, whom you and I would have likely       
OL,14, supported to the hilt, was a monster.  
OL,15, That kind of fault line in the human   
OL,16, psyche, that it can happen at all, is  
OL,17, what makes this so watchable.          
OL,19,GAnother week in a pandemic, another    
OL,20, programme to take us on a flight of    
OL,21, fantasy - open those doors and enjoy

OL,6, Never been myself (if Covid hadn't     
OL,7, struck, I would have been to Claridge's
OL,8,Gthough, harumph!), but how I would love
OL,9, to - check me in!                      
OL,11, It's familiar, this type of show, you  
OL,12, could argue predictable... but yes, I  
OL,13,Glove it! There's always a strict member
OL,14,Gof staff, a happy go lucky one who     
OL,15, sorts it all under pressure, a young   
OL,16, rookie getting it all wrong and a      
OL,17, camp...butler in this case.

OL,19, One curveball was the fact that Lynda

OL,21, the newbie getting it wrong!

OL,9,CThe Apprentice Best BitsGwas a recap we
OL,10, don't really need, I guess they want to
OL,11, produce it to plug another gaping hole 
OL,12,Gin production schedules - I think the

OL,14, now?

OL,18, is on its last legs now. Hence, these
