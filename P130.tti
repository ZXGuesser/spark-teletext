OL,8, registered its return until I noticed  
OL,9, this week's guest! The GC, Gemma

OL,13, I knew the interview was going to be   
OL,14, more than just chit chat about TOWIE   
OL,15, and all fluffy and superficial.        
OL,16, However, it's far more moving than     
OL,17, anticipated.                           
OL,19, The GC is a persona, a character, and

OL,12, bullying about her weight, heartbreak

OL,6, Matt Tebbutt is a host with the        
OL,7, potential to be extremely annoying...  
OL,8, but he also has his charms, I can't    
OL,9, always make my mind up.                
OL,11, As with any show of a similar format,  
OL,12, the guests make the mix too. This week,
OL,13, for Chinese New Year, we were treated  
OL,14, to the legend that is Ken Hom!         
OL,16, Oriental cuisine abound, treats for my 
OL,17, bleary weekend eyes!                   
OL,19, One of my favourite singers, Mica      
OL,20, Paris, was a guest too!
