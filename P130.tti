OL,6, Amanda and Clive Owen (no,not that one)
OL,7, are hill shepherds and on paper you    
OL,8, could not find a less likely match, nor
OL,9, potential reality stars. However, if   
OL,10, you sample this rural tale of multiple 
OL,11, sheep, multiple kids and multiple      
OL,12, moments of mirth and heartwarming joy, 
OL,13,Gyou'll soon be won over!               
OL,14,C                                       
OL,15, Amanda and Clive are far apart in age, 
OL,16, she sometimes dresses more for the     
OL,17, catwalk than the Yorkshire dales and   
OL,18, venturing out amongst wool and dung,   
OL,19, whereas he is a cosy homestead type,   
OL,20, stoic - yet showing vulnerability now.
