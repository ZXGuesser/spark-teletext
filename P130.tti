OL,6, Peter and Zara Phillips were a delight,
OL,7, I thought - really down to Earth for   
OL,8, people from privileged backgrounds,    
OL,9, cracking sense of humour and the same  
OL,10, no nonsense approach to life that the  
OL,11, Princess Royal has. Clearly in awe of  
OL,12, their hardworking mother too.          
OL,14, I too feel like she goes up in my      
OL,15, estimation after watching this. Whether
OL,16, you're a Royalist or Republican, after 
OL,17, watching this I'm pretty sure you'd    
OL,18, like her and have some respect - even  
OL,19, if begrudgingly.

OL,6, The Princess herself is straight       
OL,7, talking in a way that's reminiscent of 
OL,8, her father and she never stops, always 
OL,9, on the go.                             
OL,11, The sequence of a sculptor session for 
OL,12, a new bust of her was pretty funny,    
OL,13,Gwith her sharp and witty retorts. No   
OL,14,Gwonder they mentioned her portrayal in 
OL,15, The Crown, that actress had it         
OL,16, perfected!                             
OL,18,CThe Gospel According to MicaGwas a     
OL,19, welcome addition to the Friday night   
OL,20, music slot on BBC4. I always keep an   
OL,21, eye on what jewels are hidden away and 
OL,22, was excited about this.

OL,6, Having been a fan of Mica Paris since  
OL,7, my teen years, I was always going to   
OL,8, tune in and I had a feeling this would 
OL,9, be fascinating.                        
OL,11, It didn't disappoint. Mica took us on a
OL,12,Gjourney through history, peeling back  
OL,13,Gthe layers of each song. Highlighting, 
OL,14,Gif we didn't know already, that the    
OL,15, stories behind those uplifting and     
OL,16, emotional songs were often painful and 
OL,17, loaded with tales from the slave trade.
OL,19, The misery that was lived out in those 
OL,20, cotton plantations was haunting.

OL,6, It was also intriguing to gain insight 
OL,7, into Mica's own conflict - sticking    
OL,8, with the church and gospel versus      
OL,9, turning to a secular soul music career.
OL,11, It was an education and also very      
OL,12, emotional, with the style of this      
OL,13, documentary hooking me in - travels,   
OL,14, interviews, the raw emotion that Mica  
OL,15, herself felt, a coherent mix.          
OL,17, Taking us through to the climax of her 
OL,18, performing these songs with a gospel   
OL,19, choir. It was an experience and one    
OL,20, that I highly recommend!

OL,6, ITV have been broadcasting Bond films  
OL,7, each weekend - an old faithful staple  
OL,8,Gof their schedule. One on a Saturday   
OL,9, night, one on a Sunday afternoon.      
OL,11, Last night wasCOn Her Majesty's Secret 
OL,12,CServiceG- some would argue that this is
OL,13,Gthe best Bond film, for plot and       
OL,14,Gcharacter development and all round    
OL,15, quality.                               
OL,17,GAlso, it was George Lazenby's only     
OL,18, outing as Bond. If he'd continued,     
OL,19, would he be talked about now in the    
OL,20, same vein as Connery and Moore? Most   
OL,21, likely yes, he was sauve enough and    
OL,22, also displayed good humour.

OL,6, It had so much going for it, set pieces
OL,7, to impress, Telly Savalas as Blofeld   
OL,8,Gand my favourite aspect of this - Diana
OL,9, Rigg as Bond's wife.                   
OL,11, The build up to and spectacle of their

OL,13,Gshocking - with possibly more power and
OL,14,Gmore emotion in that moment than in any
OL,15, other Bond film.
