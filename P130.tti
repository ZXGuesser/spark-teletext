OL,6, A very personal account, made by her   
OL,7, son, that examined this talented       
OL,8, woman's life (she passed away in 2012) 
OL,9, in more detail than I had known before.
OL,11, Her parents were writers, who both     
OL,12, descended into alcoholism, but         
OL,13, instilled in her a decency and drive   
OL,14, that propelled her to achieve.         
OL,16, However, as one of the interviewees    
OL,17, noted, she was not a genius - and that 
OL,18, made her available to us.

OL,6, Little tales told were gold - the      
OL,7, creation of that scene in When Harry.. 
OL,8, and stories from her colleagues and    
OL,9, friends about the way she was on set   
OL,10, and when socialising.                  
OL,12, A woman who didn't suffer fools, yet   
OL,13, mellowed significantly when the news of
OL,14, her leukemia privately hit. Nobody knew
OL,15, why these subtle changes in behaviour  
OL,16, were filtering through.                
OL,18, The tone shifted - this writer, who had
OL,19, poured her personal woes and delights  
OL,20, directly into her work - kept her final
OL,21, illness private.

OL,6, Throughout her life 'everything was

OL,8, faced death it was a different matter.

OL,8, O'Hara and my fave Shangela, are all   
OL,9, alumni of RuPaul's Drag Race and embark

OL,17, Unusually, we did this already in the  
OL,18, UK, with Channel 4's Drag SOS last year
OL,19, - and this is pretty close in tone to  
OL,20, that.
