OL,13, today I was on my exercise bike whilst

OL,17,CThe SerpentGhas been recommended and I 
OL,18, am a bit late to the party! Episode one
OL,19, has me hooked though. It's got it all -
OL,20, exotic locations, stylish sets, fashion
OL,21, and retro appeal!

OL,6,GThe murderous plot is intriguing and I 
OL,7, am eager to find out more. It's got a  
OL,8, tendency to leap back and forth in time
OL,9, a lot - at least that's how it felt in 
OL,10, episode one!                           
OL,12, That's not a problem for me - when your
OL,13, favourite series of all time is Twin   
OL,14, Peaks, time travel is all good!        
OL,15,GHowever, for those easily confused by  
OL,16, that technique, brace yourselves!      
OL,18, And Jenna Coleman! She's already       
OL,19, captivating in this. Sultry, seductive,
OL,20, mysterious and effortlessly cool! I    
OL,21, cannot wait to see what more she brings
OL,22, to this. Let me get back to iPlayer!

OL,6,CThe Circle USAGcaught my eye when      
OL,7,Gscrolling through Netflix a few days   
OL,8, ago. I was hooked on the original two  
OL,9, Channel 4 series.                      
OL,11, A reality concept, the premise is based
OL,12, on a group of singles living in an     
OL,13,Gapartment building.                    
OL,14,G                                       
OL,15, They are kept separate, they cannot    
OL,16, meet, and communication is via a social
OL,17, media platform of their very own -     
OL,18, called The Circle!                     
OL,20, As you can imagine, the usual reality  
OL,21, techniques are employed...

OL,6, ...they can be voted influencers, they 
OL,7,Gplay games, they can be a 'catfish' and
OL,8, pretend to be someone else from the    
OL,9, outset.                                
OL,11, It's different and fascinating and     
OL,12,Ghighlights how you can fool others with
OL,13, an online presence and personality that
OL,14, may not match your own.                
OL,16, It's the ultimate lesson in not judging
OL,17, a book by its cover.                   
OL,19, Naturally, the 'characters' they select
OL,20, create a mix ripe for great telly! I   
OL,21, also wondered if the American version  
OL,22, would be worth the time in comparison.

OL,6, Julia has been a familiar face since   
OL,7, the nineties and never changes, one of 
OL,8, those B lister presenters who is often 
OL,9, visible but not universally known.     
OL,11, Quite a few people I know can't abide  
OL,12, the woman, I respect that as I can see 
OL,13, why.                                   
OL,15, She's not a fave, but isn't offensive  
OL,16, to me - and this kind of picturesque   
OL,17, and relaxing documentary is the kind of
OL,18, thing I feel we need right now. Give it
OL,19, a go, you may enjoy her company more   
OL,20, than you think.

OL,6, It also reminds me that ITV seems to be
OL,7, evolving a little during this time.    
OL,9, I have often had a low opinion of its  
OL,10, output in the past.                    
OL,12, Whilst I still likely watch it less    
OL,13, than any other channel, there are gems 
OL,14, forthcoming.
