OL,11, In these multi-channel days, it's      
OL,12, always worth scanning the more obscure 
OL,13, station listings - you never know what 
OL,14,Ggems you may find.                     
OL,15,G                                       
OL,16,GThe Horror Channel is one that I always
OL,17,Gkeep an eye on, as I have always been  
OL,18, fond of the genre - teenage years of A 
OL,19, Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween and 
OL,20, so many more.

OL,11, not fit the channel name and make me   
OL,12, scratch my head!                       
OL,14, However, Easter weekend was inspired!  
OL,15,GFor a couple of days, there were       
OL,16,Gclassic movie marathons that I was     
OL,17,Gdefinitely sold on.                    
OL,19, Such wonders as Dracula, the 1931 Bela 
OL,20, Lugosi film that led the way for so    
OL,21, much!

OL,6,GI hope, when more 'normality' returns, 
OL,7, that we still enjoy this crossover and 
OL,8, have additional access. It helps give  
OL,9,Gexposure to arts and performance that  
OL,10, some may never have considered before. 
OL,12, If there is to be a future for some    
OL,13,Gcreative ventures, surely this is
