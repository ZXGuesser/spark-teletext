OL,6,GThe cast is just superb, as always, and
OL,7,GKelly MacDonald is impressive already  
OL,8,Gas the lead protagonist for this run!  
OL,10, Her character's life is clearly        
OL,11, complex, with many little clues trailed
OL,12, for us already.                        
OL,14, Seeing how the lives of Hastings,      
OL,15,GFleming and Arnott have changed too    
OL,16,Gmeans the drama has a refresh that any 
OL,17,Gshow would need after five series have 
OL,18, passed.                                
OL,20, Jed Mecurio is a genius creator and    
OL,21, writer in my eyes and not in danger of 
OL,22, losing his touch any time soon!

OL,6,GYes, it was upsetting and sad - yet the
OL,7,Goverriding takeaway was an insight into
OL,8, how much Kate and her family love each 
OL,9,Gother, how strong they are together -  
OL,10,Gand how she will never give up on Derek
OL,11, and her mission to bring him back to   
OL,12,Gboth himself and to the family.        
OL,14, Poignant and uplifting.                
OL,16, I admire her so much, even more so     
OL,17, after this. You'd have to be without a 
OL,18, brain and have a heart of stone to be  
OL,19, unaffected by this.

OL,7, Derek's plight, at a time when we need

OL,6,GI thought this concept was quite ropey 
OL,7, - different people pretend a house is
