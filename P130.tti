OL,6, Journalist Frank Gardner has always    
OL,7, been authoritative, yet down to Earth; 
OL,8, accessible, yet sometimes aloof - I've 
OL,9, always admired his work.               
OL,11, In case you don't know, Frank and a BBC
OL,12, cameraman were ambushed in Saudi Arabia
OL,13, sixteen years ago by al-Qaeda. He was  
OL,14,Gshot multiple times and left disabled  
OL,15, and in a wheelchair since.             
OL,17, The documentary was moving, uplifting, 
OL,18, poignant, showing incredible stoicism  
OL,19, from Gardner and anecdotes that left   
OL,20, the viewer breathless.

OL,6, The gruelling horror of what he went   
OL,7, through would be enough to defeat most 
OL,8, of us, but he's powered on, still      
OL,9, working and still with a passion for   
OL,10, life and in his work and love for      
OL,11, humanity - the interest in his fellow  
OL,12,Gman is plain to see.                   
OL,14, In one section of the programme, he met
OL,15,Ga young man whose disability was even  
OL,16,Gmore potentially life limiting, was    
OL,17, inflicted upon him at a younger age -  
OL,18, but something that he expressed himself
OL,19,Gabout beautifully. He was even more    
OL,20, positive than Frank, who was in awe of 
OL,21, him.

OL,6,GTalent shows are ten a penny these days

OL,11, They're likable enough (this makes me  
OL,12,Gsound old, but WHAT were they          
OL,13,Gwearing?!) but not really slick and    
OL,14, professional enough for me to take them

OL,6,GAs with many such shows,some of the

OL,6,GIt does beg the question, why would    
OL,7,Ganyone go back before Covid is all but 
OL,8, gone from everyday life, but places    
OL,9, like theme parks are a huge part of    
OL,10, 'normal fun'.                          
OL,12, Therefore, swathes of the public are   
OL,13, determined to be there - just as much
