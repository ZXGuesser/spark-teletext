OL,6, Some warm company through those Wintry 
OL,7, mornings.                              
OL,9, Gethin Jones and Kym Marsh have proven 
OL,10, to be great hosts for this, so engaging
OL,11, and creating that family feel for this 
OL,12, programme, something essential to      
OL,13, success.                               
OL,14,G                                       
OL,15, Otherwise, what would be the point? It 
OL,16, would be a cold mish mash of medical   
OL,17, advice (Doctor Xand), household        
OL,18, furnishings tips (Will Kirk from The   
OL,19, Repair Shop) and several other items   
OL,20, that are luckily interwoven with plenty
OL,21, of bants!

OL,6, In fact, I think that's one of my      
OL,7, favourite things about it - you feel as
OL,8, though everyone is on the brink of     
OL,9, innuendo and cracking up into gales of 
OL,10, laughter, an even more convincing sign 
OL,11,Gthat they get on well.

OL,6, I've always liked Steph, since her     
OL,7, breakfast telly days, and I did like   
OL,8,Gthe format. Sprinkled with the         
OL,9, occasional celeb too, this week saw an 
OL,10, appearance by the hilarious Biggins!   
OL,12, He was reminiscing about Barbara       
OL,13,GWindsor and, in telling an anecdote,   
OL,14,Gmouthed some expletives! That, coupled 
OL,15,Gwith an apology from Steph whilst      
OL,16,Gstifling her laughter and Biggins      
OL,17, saying 'sorry, sorry!', just made it   
OL,18,Geven funnier!                          
OL,20, They'll be back and keeping many       
OL,21, company - but will we need them as much
OL,22, in a post-vaccine world?
