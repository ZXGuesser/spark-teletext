OL,7,GJohn and Olly Alexander, performing

OL,6,GI love this show and also the fact that
OL,7,GMichael Sheen and Jennifer Saunders are
OL,8, team captains - clearly a sign that    
OL,9,Gthey really love doing this, ensuring  
OL,10,Gthey schedule in with other work.      
OL,12,GIt's great fun, filled with sketches,  
OL,13, comedy re-enactments of film scenes    
OL,14, with the celeb guests. Also,rounds of  
OL,15, quiz questions and fun facts for film  
OL,16, fans - naturally filled with laughs    
OL,17, along the way too.                     
OL,19, It's a great way to just unwind and    
OL,20, have a great chuckle - and possibly    
OL,21, learn a thing or two about the industry
OL,22, at the same time!

OL,6,GFinally, I've been looking forward to  
OL,7, the new Ryan Murphy seriesCHalston,    
OL,8, which debuted on Netflix on Friday.    
OL,9,GHaving just seen episode one, I feel   
OL,10, disappointed.                          
OL,12, Ewan McGregor rarely lets us down, but 
OL,13,GI'm not sure if his performance is     
OL,14,Gpurely down to the character of the    
OL,15,Greal Halston, or if it's some kind of  
OL,16, lazy parody of a fashionista template. 
OL,17,G                                       
OL,18,GIt seemed to coast along, Halston      
OL,19,Gseeing huge success in the blink of an 
OL,20,Geye...but it lacked excitement, I found
OL,21, myself not giving a toss!

OL,6,GI've always loved the majority from the
OL,7, Murphy stable, so I am going to see it 
OL,8, through - and maybe as his life story  
OL,9,Gpans out I will change my mind...
