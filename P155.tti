OL,5, Dateline: 21st December 1981 and my    
OL,6, then 7 year old self settled down in   
OL,7, front of the TV to enjoy the final     
OL,8, episode of series 4 of Blake's 7. This 
OL,9, was an episode I was awaiting with keen
OL,10, anticipation as the titular character  
OL,11, was due to return to the show.         
OL,13, Now truth be told I didn't actually    
OL,14, remember Blake that well what with     
OL,15, being only 4 when Gareth Thomas made   
OL,16, his final regular appearance.          
OL,17, Intriguingly it was also being promoted
OL,18, as a shocker of an episode. Still that 
OL,19, didn't faze me as images of unwrapping 
OL,20, presents and gorging on chocolates in  
OL,21, just a few days danced through my head.

OL,5, The episode began with them blowing up 
OL,6, their base, a bit extreme I thought.   
OL,7, Actually I was a kid so I probably     
OL,8, believed somebody had gone out and left
OL,9, the gas oven on, this coming a few     
OL,10, short weeks after my friend's sister   
OL,11, destroyed their kitchen whilst         
OL,12, attempting to fry chips!               
OL,14, Then things started going downhill fast
OL,15, as Scorpio came under attack with      
OL,16, Tarrant volunteering to try to take the
OL,17, damaged ship down safely and being     
OL,18, about as successful as my skills in    
OL,19, pulling the girls in my later single   
OL,20, years!

OL,5, Sadly all the drama of this moment was 
OL,6, lost as for some reason it looked like 
OL,7, the crew had installed a fun slide in  
OL,8, the middle of Scorpio's cockpit which  
OL,9, Tarrant gleefully took a turn on!      
OL,10, Honestly apart from the crushing final 
OL,11, five minutes the only thing my friends 
OL,12, talked about was how fun that looked.  
OL,14, Of course soon after Blake made his    
OL,15, proper return to the show his scar not 
OL,16, bothering me one bit as living on an   
OL,17, East Hull council estate I'd seen      
OL,18, worse! Everybody came together and this
OL,19, was the moment part of my youthful     
OL,20, innocence died.

OL,6, of shot in Blake's 7, this time there  
OL,7, was gore, lots of gore and then just   
OL,8, for good measure Avon shot him again...
OL,9, and again. Blake slumped to his knees  
OL,10, (and off screen I'm sure so did his    
OL,11, intentines!) and unquestionably died.  
OL,13, Then a woman revealed herself to be a  
OL,14, baddie and held our heroes at gunpoint.
OL,15, Dayna had a complete brain fart moment 
OL,16, and decided she could bend down, pick  
OL,17, up a gun, aim and shoot at their captor
OL,18, before she could be shot herself.      
OL,19, Needless to say that didn't work out so
OL,20, well and Dayna dropped to the floor at 
OL,21, the same time as many viewers jaws did.
