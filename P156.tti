OL,5, Over the years there have been legends.
OL,6, From the BBC you had the likes of David
OL,7, Allan, David Miles, Peter Bolgar, Peter
OL,8, Brook, Michael Maine, to name a few who
OL,9, were there to introduce the programmes 
OL,10, to you on either BBC1 or BBC2.         
OL,12, They were never in-vision so it did    
OL,13, feel like the globe or the clock was   
OL,14, talking to you. With the BBC it had a  
OL,15, good strong list of announcers over the
OL,16, regions. Until 1980 the regions had in-
OL,17, vision announcing but only at certain  
OL,18, times. With the South East, they were  
OL,19, very seldom in-vision... very rare     
OL,20, infact.

OL,5, Although they were usually out of      
OL,6, vision some announcers doubled up as   
OL,7, news readers which in turn made them   
OL,8, more recognisable. I loved the voices  
OL,9, of this time from the 1960s to the     
OL,10, 1990s, something sadly that is slightly
OL,11, lacking with today's announcers.       
OL,13, For ITV you had legendary announcers   
OL,14, like Redvers Kyle, Colin Weston, Steve 
OL,15, Hamilton, Tony Currie, Neville Wainless
OL,16, etc... whose voices graced our ITV     
OL,17, screens over the years in the different
OL,18, regions. With the exception of YTV most
OL,19, of the ITV regions were in-vision so   
OL,20, announcers became well-known stars.

OL,5, Even though Redvers was in-vision on   
OL,6, Rediffusion London he very rarely      
OL,7, appeared in-vision on Yorkshire        
OL,8, Television but his voice was always    
OL,9, recognised very quickly.               
OL,11, For me I was born in the late 1980s    
OL,12, which meant I grew up remembering the  
OL,13, voices of the 1990s. With Ulster       
OL,14, Television (now UTV) we had the        
OL,15, legendary Julian Simmons who'd light   
OL,16, up anyone's day with his fantastic     
OL,17, announcing and intro's, especially into
OL,18, Coronation Street.

OL,5, After looking back on clips of         
OL,6, continuity announcers over the years it
OL,7, was always a nice feeling of warmth    
OL,8, that radiated off them, especially when
OL,9, it came to closedowns.                 
OL,11, When it came to Christmas closedowns   
OL,12, there have been stories of announcers  
OL,13, being rather tipsy, which would've made
OL,14, it even more fun, as you wouldn't know 
OL,15, what they would end up saying!         
OL,17, And at New Year some of them would've  
OL,18, been celebrating to compensate being at
OL,19, work with I'd say a right glass of     
OL,20, champagne and a few party streamers.

OL,5, Today's continuity announcers are      
OL,6, following in the footsteps of their    
OL,7, predecessors - though they don't have  
OL,8, the same work from years ago as now    
OL,9, it's mainly computerised, whereas the  
OL,10, old announcers did a lot of the work   
OL,11, themselves live. So let's embrace the  
OL,12, era of announcers from years gone by.  
OL,13, Sadly quite a lot are now gone but we  
OL,14, can cherish the memories of their witty
OL,15, and wonderful announcements and their  
OL,16, bloopers and suchlike.                 
OL,18, As an announcer would sign off... This 
OL,19, is Amy Lou McCloughan wishing you all a
OL,20, safe and peaceful day for tomorrow.    
OL,21, Goodnight and sleep well.
