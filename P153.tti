OL,5, As weird and as plain screwed up as it 
OL,6, might seem, dear reader, I've always   
OL,7, felt a bizarre affinity towards the    
OL,8, technically still current ITV franchise
OL,9, holder for the South East, and not just
OL,10, owing to the fact that the South East  
OL,11, is where I live. I know, I know,       
OL,12, Meridian were no Granada in terms of   
OL,13, programme output, but my friends, what 
OL,14, a logo they had back in the day. What a
OL,15, logo indeed.                           
OL,17, Not a simple logo by any stretch, not  
OL,18, the sort of thing that would work as a 
OL,19, tiny app icon (as the 1999 ITV generic 
OL,20, look excruciatingly demonstrated), but 
OL,21, recognisable without a doubt.

OL,5, And my word did it do untold damage to 
OL,6, my psyche as a kid. I remember staying 
OL,7, at my Grandma's one night and the      
OL,8, Meridian logo suddenly appearing at the
OL,9, end of some programme on the TV. Being 
OL,10, very young, I was frightened to death  
OL,11, by it. So much so that I had trouble   
OL,12, sleeping that night, and that in the   
OL,13, future whenever I was given the choice 
OL,14, of staying overnight at my Nan's house 
OL,15, or at Grandma's, for several years     
OL,16, afterwards I always chose Nan's without
OL,17, fail, resolute in my fear that that    
OL,18, intrusive and unnerving face of fire   
OL,19, was waiting at Grandma's to sneak into 
OL,20, my hastily prepared bedroom and petrify
OL,21, my soul.

OL,5, You may think that this is a bad thing,
OL,6, but I look back on those days fondly.  
OL,7, For a logo to have such a strong impact
OL,8, despite it only being on screen for a  
OL,9, few seconds is no mean feat.           
OL,11, In addition, I think children should be
OL,12, frightened more often by the TV that   
OL,13, they're spoon-fed, as it's good        
OL,14, character building and it worked in the
OL,15, 70s.                                   
OL,17, But having just seen Meridian's        
OL,18, inaugural broadcast, I now have an     
OL,19, unfortunate suspicion that the sunburst
OL,20, logo was the only good thing about     
OL,21, Meridian besides Dinenage and Thrower.
